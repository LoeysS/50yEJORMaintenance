In our MSSP, a company has to staff multiple shifts for each workday in the presence of uncertain arrival rates that vary throughout the day and patient “customers” that do not abandon the queue while waiting for a service, but who must be served by some pre-defined time. Drawing on established methods in both capacity management and prescriptive analytics, we propose to use fluid and stationary approximations of the demand arrival process to apply tailored prescriptive analytics approaches to determine staffing levels for multiple interrelated shifts. The prescriptive analytics approaches rely on machine learning techniques that incorporate a detailed representation of the non-stationary structure of arrivals and leverage extensive auxiliary data. In particular, we adapt established prescriptive analytics approaches—weighted sample average approximation and kernelized empirical risk minimization—and propose a new optimization prediction approach to solving the multi-shift staffing problem. Using a case study that is based on extensive data from our project partner, the maintenance service provider, we demonstrate the applicability of these approaches, highlight their benefits over traditional “estimate then optimize” approaches, and shed light on their structural properties and performance drivers.","('Data-driven OM', 'Decision support systems', 'Machine learning', 'Prescriptive analytics', 'Queuing')",prescript analyt multi shift staf problem elsevi b v motiv work industri partner paper propos examin novel data driven approach solv certain type capac size problem term multi shift staf problem mssp in mssp compani staff multipl shift workday presenc uncertain arriv rate vari throughout day patient custom abandon queue wait servic must serv pre defin time draw establish method capac manag prescript analyt propos use fluid stationari approxim demand arriv process appli tailor prescript analyt approach determin staf level multipl interrel shift the prescript analyt approach reli machin learn techniqu incorpor detail represent non stationari structur arriv leverag extens auxiliari data in particular adapt establish prescript analyt approach weight sampl averag approxim kernel empir risk minim and propos new optim predict approach solv multi shift staf problem use case studi base extens data project partner mainten servic provid demonstr applic approach highlight benefit tradit estim optim approach shed light structur properti perform driver data driven om decis support system machin learn prescript analyt queu

To minimize maintenance costs and maximize productivity, maintenance tasks are often grouped and carried out simultaneously. We consider the problem of obtaining an optimal maintenance schedule when the multi-component system is also a networked system and can be modeled as a directed graph, where nodes represent machines or workers, and edges represent the exchange of material, information, or work between these nodes. To find efficient maintenance schedules, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem, which considers the limited availability of maintenance personnel, and we propose an algorithm that finds a set of maintenance schedules, which are a good approximation of the Pareto front in terms of costs and productivity. Through sensitivity analysis we show the extent to which adding maintenance personnel improves system productivity at the expense of increased maintenance costs and idle time of some resources. Besides solving the Pareto-optimal schedules, we show how the developed model is useful in maintenance personnel planning, and we outline limitations and future developments of the present work.","('Direct graph', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Maintenance optimization', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Opportunistic Maintenance')",an approach bi object mainten schedul network system limit resourc elsevi b v prevent mainten activ often caus downtim technic multi compon system to minim mainten cost maxim product mainten task often group carri simultan we consid problem obtain optim mainten schedul multi compon system also network system model direct graph node repres machin worker edg repres exchang materi inform work node to find effici mainten schedul formul bi object optim problem consid limit avail mainten personnel propos algorithm find set mainten schedul good approxim pareto front term cost product through sensit analysi show extent ad mainten personnel improv system product expens increas mainten cost idl time resourc besid solv pareto optim schedul show develop model use mainten personnel plan outlin limit futur develop present work direct graph genet algorithm mainten optim multi object optim opportunist mainten

Existing maintenance in the proportional hazards model was primarily concerned with replacement, resulting in excessive maintenance for many repairable systems. This paper develops a novel hybrid repair-replacement model in the proportional hazards model with a stochastically increasing Markovian covariate process. Preventive repair reduces both age and covariate, and the reduction rate decreases as the number of repairs increases. At an inspection epoch where the system age, covariate state, and repair number are available, the decision-maker considers three possible actions, i.e., no maintenance, preventive repair, and preventive replacement. The objective is to derive the optimal policy that minimizes the long-run average maintenance cost rate. The optimization problem is formulated in the semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) framework. The structural properties of the optimal policy are examined to reduce the policy space. Then a policy-iteration algorithm with a backward policy-improvement step is developed for efficiently finding the optimization results. A practical numerical example with sensitivity analysis is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A comparison with two heuristic policies confirms the superiority of the proposed policy in reducing maintenance costs.","('Hybrid repair model', 'Maintenance', 'Policy structure', 'Proportional hazards model', 'Replacement policy')",a hybrid repair replac polici proport hazard model elsevi b v cox s proport hazard model wide use describ hazard rate system deterior age diagnost covari exist mainten proport hazard model primarili concern replac result excess mainten mani repair system this paper develop novel hybrid repair replac model proport hazard model stochast increas markovian covari process prevent repair reduc age covari reduct rate decreas number repair increas at inspect epoch system age covari state repair number avail decis maker consid three possibl action i e mainten prevent repair prevent replac the object deriv optim polici minim long run averag mainten cost rate the optim problem formul semi markov decis process smdp framework the structur properti optim polici examin reduc polici space then polici iter algorithm backward polici improv step develop effici find optim result a practic numer exampl sensit analysi conduct illustr effect propos approach a comparison two heurist polici confirm superior propos polici reduc mainten cost hybrid repair model mainten polici structur proport hazard model replac polici

These contracts cover all maintenance-related costs for a fixed, upfront fee during a predetermined horizon. Charging each contract a price proportional to its risk prevents adverse selection by incentivizing low risk (i.e., maintenance-light) profiles to not renege on their agreements. We borrow techniques from non-life insurance pricing and tailor them to the setting of maintenance contracts to assess the risk and estimate the expected maintenance costs under a full-service contract. We apply the framework on a portfolio of about 5000 full-service contracts of industrial equipment and show how a data-driven analysis based on contract and machine characteristics, or risk factors, supports a differentiated, risk-based break-even tariff plan. We employ generalized additive models (GAMs) to predict the risk factors’ impact on the frequency (number of) and severity (cost) of maintenance interventions. GAMs are interpretable yet flexible statistical models that capture the effect of both continuous and categorical risk factors. Our predictive models quantify the impact of the contract and machine type, service history, and machine running hours on the contract cost. We additionally utilize the predictive cost distributions of our models to augment the break-even price with the appropriate risk margins to further protect against the inherently stochastic nature of the maintenance costs. The framework shows how maintenance intervention data can set up a differentiated tariff plan.","('Empirical analysis', 'Frequency-severity modeling', 'Maintenance', 'Predictive analytics', 'Risk assessment')",empir risk assess mainten cost full servic contract elsevi b v we provid data driven framework conduct risk assess includ data pre process explor statist model portfolio full servic mainten contract these contract cover mainten relat cost fix upfront fee predetermin horizon charg contract price proport risk prevent advers select incentiv low risk i e mainten light profil reneg agreement we borrow techniqu non life insur price tailor set mainten contract assess risk estim expect mainten cost full servic contract we appli framework portfolio full servic contract industri equip show data driven analysi base contract machin characterist risk factor support differenti risk base break even tariff plan we employ general addit model gam predict risk factor impact frequenc number of sever cost mainten intervent gam interpret yet flexibl statist model captur effect continu categor risk factor our predict model quantifi impact contract machin type servic histori machin run hour contract cost we addit util predict cost distribut model augment break even price appropri risk margin protect inher stochast natur mainten cost the framework show mainten intervent data set differenti tariff plan empir analysi frequenc sever model mainten predict analyt risk assess

We model the problem using a sequential predict, then optimize approach. In our prescriptive optimization model, we use a finite horizon Markov decision process with a variable order Markov chain, in which the chain length varies depending on the time since the last preventive maintenance action was performed. The model therefore captures the dependency of a machine's failures on both recent failures as well as preventive maintenance actions, via our prediction model. We validate our model using an original equipment manufacturer data set and obtain policies that prescribe when to deviate from the planned periodic maintenance schedule. To improve our predictions for machine failure behavior with limited to no past data, we pool our data set over different machine classes by means of a Poisson generalized linear model.

An age-based replacement policy is applied to preventively replace the component before its failure. The components used for replacement come from either a weak population or a strong population, referred to as population heterogeneity. However, the true population type is unknown to the decision maker. By considering that the decision maker has a belief on the probability of having a weak population, we build a partially observable Markov decision process model with the objective of minimizing the total cost over the lifespan of the system. The resulting optimal policy updates the belief variable in a Bayesian fashion by using the data obtained over the course of the system lifespan, and it denotes when to execute preventive replacement. It optimally balances the trade-off between the cost of learning the true population type (via deliberately delaying the preventive replacement time to better learn the population type) and the cost of maintenance activities. By addressing this so-called exploration-exploitation trade-off, we generate insights on the optimal policy and compare its performance with existing heuristic approaches from the literature. We also characterize a lower bound to the optimal cost, allowing us to determine the value of resolving the uncertainty on the population type.","('Age-based replacement', 'Bayesian learning', 'Maintenance', 'Partially observable Markov decision processes', 'Population heterogeneity')",age base mainten popul heterogen optim explor exploit the author s we consid system finit lifespan singl critic compon subject random failur an age base replac polici appli prevent replac compon failur the compon use replac come either weak popul strong popul refer popul heterogen howev true popul type unknown decis maker by consid decis maker belief probabl weak popul build partial observ markov decis process model object minim total cost lifespan system the result optim polici updat belief variabl bayesian fashion use data obtain cours system lifespan denot execut prevent replac it optim balanc trade off cost learn true popul type via deliber delay prevent replac time better learn popul type cost mainten activ by address so call explor exploit trade off generat insight optim polici compar perform exist heurist approach literatur we also character lower bound optim cost allow us determin valu resolv uncertainti popul type age base replac bayesian learn mainten partial observ markov decis process popul heterogen

The Aircraft Recovery Problem (ARP) is usually solved to help airlines repair disrupted schedules by properly rescheduling their flights and rerouting the aircraft such that the total recovery cost is minimized while a set of operational and maintenance constraints are satisfied. When the flight retiming is allowed in a recovery solution, we can copy a flight by shifting its scheduled time and include the copies in the ARP model to determine either the original flight or one of its copies is to be flown by an aircraft. Many previous studies generate flight copies in some arbitrary manner and the quality of each copy is not assessed. In this paper, we propose a copy evaluation method and develop a solution approach to the ARP by incorporating the method within an iterative process of copy generation and filtration. The approach relies on repeatedly solving the ARP linear programming relaxation defined on time-space networks with respect to each aircraft and evaluating the copies to be added into the networks based on the solution obtained. The goal is to produce a limited number of copies but enough to help reduce recovery cost. Through computational experiments using real airline data, we demonstrate that our approach is able to provide promising recovery solutions in reasonable computational time.","('Aircraft recovery problem', 'Copy generation', 'Disruption management', 'Irregular operations', 'Transportation')",an iter cost driven copi generat approach aircraft recoveri problem elsevi b v airlin schedul frequent disrupt unexpect event poor weather condit aircraft mechan failur airport congest crew absenc result tremend cost airlin passeng addit origin plan the aircraft recoveri problem arp usual solv help airlin repair disrupt schedul proper reschedul flight rerout aircraft total recoveri cost minim set oper mainten constraint satisfi when flight retim allow recoveri solut copi flight shift schedul time includ copi arp model determin either origin flight one copi flown aircraft mani previous studi generat flight copi arbitrari manner qualiti copi assess in paper propos copi evalu method develop solut approach arp incorpor method within iter process copi generat filtrat the approach reli repeat solv arp linear program relax defin time space network respect aircraft evalu copi ad network base solut obtain the goal produc limit number copi enough help reduc recoveri cost through comput experi use real airlin data demonstr approach abl provid promis recoveri solut reason comput time aircraft recoveri problem copi generat disrupt manag irregular oper transport

The objective is to minimize the total wasted utilization interval between maintenance checks while reducing the need for additional maintenance slots. By achieving this goal, one is also reducing the number of maintenance checks and increasing aircraft availability while respecting airworthiness regulations. We validate the proposed methodology using the fleet maintenance data from a major European airline. The descriptive statistics of several test runs show that, when compared with the current practice, the proposed methodology potentially reduces the number of A-checks by 1.9%, the number of C-checks by 9.8%, and the number of additional slots by 78.3% over four years.","('Approximate dynamic programming', 'Lookahead policy', 'Scheduling', 'Stochastic optimization')",lookahead approxim dynam program stochast aircraft mainten check schedul optim the author s this paper propos lookahead approxim dynam program methodolog aircraft mainten check schedul consid uncertainti aircraft daili util mainten check elaps time it adopt dynam program framework use hybrid lookahead schedul polici the hybrid lookahead schedul polici make one step optim decis heavi aircraft mainten base determinist forecast determin light mainten accord stochast forecast the object minim total wast util interv mainten check reduc need addit mainten slot by achiev goal one also reduc number mainten check increas aircraft avail respect airworthi regul we valid propos methodolog use fleet mainten data major european airlin the descript statist sever test run show that compar current practic propos methodolog potenti reduc number a check number c check number addit slot four year approxim dynam program lookahead polici schedul stochast optim

The considered system has a K-out-of-N reliability structure, and components deteriorate according to a multivariate gamma process with Lévy copula dependence. The TBM and CBM models are formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and optimal policies are found using dynamic programming. Solving the CBM model requires that the continuous deterioration process is discretized. We therefore investigate the discretization level required for obtaining a near-optimal policy. Our results indicate that a coarser discretization level than previously suggested in the literature is adequate, indicating that dynamic programming is a feasible approach for optimization in multi-component systems. We further demonstrate this through empirical results for the size limit of the MDP models when solved with an optimized implementation of modified policy iteration. The TBM model can generally be solved with more components than the CBM model, since the former has a sparser state transition structure. In the special case of independent component deterioration, transition probabilities can be calculated efficiently at runtime. This reduces the memory requirements substantially. For this case, we also achieved a tenfold speedup when using ten processors in a parallel implementation of algorithm. Altogether, our results show that the computational requirements for systems with independent component deterioration increase at a slower rate than for systems with stochastic dependence.","('Dynamic programming', 'Maintenance', 'Markov decision process', 'Multi-component system', 'Numerical study')",a numer studi markov decis process algorithm multi compon replac problem elsevi b v we present unifi model framework time base mainten tbm condit base mainten cbm optim replac multi compon system the consid system k out of n reliabl structur compon deterior accord multivari gamma process l vy copula depend the tbm cbm model formul markov decis process mdps optim polici found use dynam program solv cbm model requir continu deterior process discret we therefor investig discret level requir obtain near optim polici our result indic coarser discret level previous suggest literatur adequ indic dynam program feasibl approach optim multi compon system we demonstr empir result size limit mdp model solv optim implement modifi polici iter the tbm model general solv compon cbm model sinc former sparser state transit structur in special case independ compon deterior transit probabl calcul effici runtim this reduc memori requir substanti for case also achiev tenfold speedup use ten processor parallel implement algorithm altogeth result show comput requir system independ compon deterior increas slower rate system stochast depend dynam program mainten markov decis process multi compon system numer studi

Internet backbone router is essentially the core router of Internet backbone and its performance is mainly relevant to the reliability of its mainboard. The mainboard is an embedded system consisting of hardware and software. Its reliability testing involves executing a number of test cases, which are designed to expose potential defects, under harsh environmental conditions. The testing process is largely prolonged due to the dramatic increase of the number of test cases, mainly due to the continuous increase and upgrade of its functional modules. Thus, there is a big demand from industry to improve the reliability testing efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we exploit the principles of regression testing in software maintenance: test case selection and prioritization, and construct two testing planning models to largely reduce the testing time as well as to improve the effectiveness of failure detections. The former is a two-step model we introduced in previous work that optimizes test case selection and test case sequencing sequentially. The latter, an integrated model is newly developed, optimizing the test case selection and sequencing simultaneously with the precedence constraints among the test cases. Moreover, we propose exact algorithms based on branch-and-price for solving these two models. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating that the integrated model outperforms the two-step method and the advantage is more significant if the sequencing objective has greater weight in the integrated objective function.","('Branch-and-price', 'Reliability', 'Reliability testing plan', 'Test case selection', 'Test case sequencing')",integr optim test case select sequenc reliabl test mainboard internet backbon router elsevi b v internet backbon refer princip data rout larg strateg interconnect network core router internet internet backbon router essenti core router internet backbon perform main relev reliabl mainboard the mainboard embed system consist hardwar softwar it reliabl test involv execut number test case design expos potenti defect harsh environment condit the test process larg prolong due dramat increas number test case main due continu increas upgrad function modul thus big demand industri improv reliabl test effici effect in work exploit principl regress test softwar mainten test case select priorit construct two test plan model larg reduc test time well improv effect failur detect the former two step model introduc previous work optim test case select test case sequenc sequenti the latter integr model newli develop optim test case select sequenc simultan preced constraint among test case moreov propos exact algorithm base branch and price solv two model final present case studi demonstr integr model outperform two step method advantag signific sequenc object greater weight integr object function branch and price reliabl reliabl test plan test case select test case sequenc

The production process is equipped with a predictive model, generating alert and no-alert signals. An alert signal indicates that production process is in the defective state, while a no-alert signal indicates it is in the healthy state. The signals are imperfect, meaning that an alert signal can be generated for a healthy process and a no-alert signal can be generated for a defective process. Only a costly inspection can detect the true condition. We introduce a new inspection policy, which generalizes the age-based inspection policy that performs planned inspections at predetermined intervals, by considering that an inspection can also be triggered by a certain number of alerts from the predictive model. To optimize the proposed inspection policy, a stochastic dynamic programming model is formulated with the objective of minimizing the long-run expected cost rate. The performance improvement achieved by the optimal policy is quantified by comparing it to practically relevant benchmark policies. Numerical experiments with a set of realistic problem instances show that adding alert-triggered inspections to traditional age-based inspection scheduling brings up to 44% reduction in the expected cost rate when the predictive model is sufficiently accurate. Characterizing the performance of the optimal policy at a given level of imperfectness is especially useful in practice as it allows making an assessment on how much can be invested to justify a certain level of improvement in the predictive model.","('Delay-time model', 'Dynamic programming', 'Imperfect predictive alerts', 'Inspection planning', 'Maintenance')",an alert assist inspect polici product process imperfect condit signal the author s we studi inspect schedul decis product process goe hidden defect state failur the product process equip predict model generat alert no alert signal an alert signal indic product process defect state no alert signal indic healthi state the signal imperfect mean alert signal generat healthi process no alert signal generat defect process onli cost inspect detect true condit we introduc new inspect polici general age base inspect polici perform plan inspect predetermin interv consid inspect also trigger certain number alert predict model to optim propos inspect polici stochast dynam program model formul object minim long run expect cost rate the perform improv achiev optim polici quantifi compar practic relev benchmark polici numer experi set realist problem instanc show ad alert trigger inspect tradit age base inspect schedul bring reduct expect cost rate predict model suffici accur character perform optim polici given level imperfect especi use practic allow make assess much invest justifi certain level improv predict model delay time model dynam program imperfect predict alert inspect plan mainten

In this paper, we model and solve a joint problem of strategic workforce planning and fleet renewal in a military context. The joint problem studied involves addressing a trade-off among several costs (e.g., workforce, maintenance, operating, etc.) and operational readiness (availability) of the fleet. To make such trade-offs, the decisions associated with workforce planning (i.e., the recruitment and the career progression of the workforce) and fleet renewal (i.e., the timing of asset replacements) strategies have to be simultaneously considered and optimized. We develop a simulation-optimization approach by coupling a system dynamics (SD) simulation model and a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the joint problem. In the developed approach, the GA generates candidate workforce planning and fleet renewal strategies to find the best joint strategy. Then, the candidate workforce planning and renewal strategies are passed to the SD model which simulates both the career progression of the workforce and the life-cycle of assets to evaluate the total cost. We illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the joint model on a realistic case study motivated by the recent modernization efforts of the Royal Australian Navy. The results obtained indicate that this approach leads to a considerable cost reduction and identifies the causes of inferior performance. We also test the robustness of the optimized strategies under uncertainty by sensitivity and scenario discovery analyses to infer further insights.","('Fleet renewal', 'Genetic algorithm', 'Military workforce planning', 'OR in defense', 'Simulation-optimization')",a joint problem strateg workforc plan fleet renew with applic defens elsevi b v reduct defens expenditur requir holist coordin plan two critic interconnect defens capabl name fleet asset workforc requir in paper model solv joint problem strateg workforc plan fleet renew militari context the joint problem studi involv address trade off among sever cost e g workforc mainten oper etc oper readi avail fleet to make trade off decis associ workforc plan i e recruit career progress workforc fleet renew i e time asset replac strategi simultan consid optim we develop simul optim approach coupl system dynam sd simul model genet algorithm ga solv joint problem in develop approach ga generat candid workforc plan fleet renew strategi find best joint strategi then candid workforc plan renew strategi pass sd model simul career progress workforc life cycl asset evalu total cost we illustr applic effect joint model realist case studi motiv recent modern effort royal australian navi the result obtain indic approach lead consider cost reduct identifi caus inferior perform we also test robust optim strategi uncertainti sensit scenario discoveri analys infer insight fleet renew genet algorithm militari workforc plan or defens simul optim

Nevertheless, there is sparse research that aims to optimise maintenance policies for reducing the GHG emissions from systems such as automotive vehicles or building service systems. To fill up this gap, this paper optimises replacement policies for systems that age and degrade and that produce GHG emissions (i.e., exhaust emissions) including the initial manufacturing GHG emissions produced during the manufacturing stage and the emissions generated during the operational stage. Both the exhaust emissions process and the failure process are considered as functions of two time scales (i.e., age and accumulated usage), respectively. Other factors that may affect the two processes such as ambient temperature and road conditions are depicted as random effects. Under these settings, the decision problem is a nonlinear programming problem subject to several constraints. Replacement policies are then developed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methods.","('Condition-based monitoring', 'Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Integer nonlinear programming', 'Maintenance policy', 'Two time scales')",consid greenhous gas emiss mainten optimis the author s greenhous gase ghg human activ main contributor climat chang sinc mid th centuri reduc releas ghg emiss becom themat research topic mani research disciplin in reliabl research communiti research paper relat reliabl mainten system power generat farm offshor farm nevertheless spars research aim optimis mainten polici reduc ghg emiss system automot vehicl build servic system to fill gap paper optimis replac polici system age degrad produc ghg emiss i e exhaust emiss includ initi manufactur ghg emiss produc manufactur stage emiss generat oper stage both exhaust emiss process failur process consid function two time scale i e age accumul usag respect other factor may affect two process ambient temperatur road condit depict random effect under set decis problem nonlinear program problem subject sever constraint replac polici develop numer exampl provid illustr propos method condit base monitor greenhous gas emiss integ nonlinear program mainten polici two time scale

This paper addresses the problem of jointly optimising TC demurrage policy and TC flow, in the face of uncertain TC maintenance times, to maximise profits. A progressive hedging algorithm with expanded time-space network (PHA-ETSN) is designed to tackle this tactical level optimisation problem as other established techniques struggle with this optimisation in terms of computational time and memory requirements. Experiments are performed to illustrate how the optimisation tool can be used to investigate how demurrage policy affects different operational costs and TC hire revenue and thereby profit. These experiments demonstrate how the optimisation tool can be used by managers not only to optimise demurrage policy but also to explore and to understand more deeply the costs and profits in their operations.","('Detention and demurrage', 'OR in maritime industry', 'Pricing and fleet size optimisation', 'Progressive hedging algorithm', 'Time-space network modelling')",joint tank contain demurrag polici flow optimis use progress hedg algorithm expand time space network elsevi b v a key featur tank contain tc oper industri custom overhold tcs provid temporari storag equip content rather provid storag facil tc oper charg profit fee demurrag charg servic make attract busi proposit detriment holist network flow fleet size this paper address problem joint optimis tc demurrag polici tc flow face uncertain tc mainten time maximis profit a progress hedg algorithm expand time space network pha etsn design tackl tactic level optimis problem establish techniqu struggl optimis term comput time memori requir experi perform illustr optimis tool use investig demurrag polici affect differ oper cost tc hire revenu therebi profit these experi demonstr optimis tool use manag optimis demurrag polici also explor understand deepli cost profit oper detent demurrag or maritim industri price fleet size optimis progress hedg algorithm time space network model

The maintenance activities are optimised over a planning horizon by simultaneously coordinating the SOV and the STB. A mixed-integer linear programming model is designed, where the objective function is to minimise the total maintenance cost. As the proposed mathematical model is hard to solve with a commercial solver, a decomposition approach is developed.

The performance of the solution method is evaluated using the Thanet Offshore Wind Farm, in the southeast of the UK.

The application of LASSO enables the identification of relevant predictor variables for forecasting purposes. Based on the Brier score and the ranked probability score (and their skill scores), we document substantial predictive ability of our method which outperforms five benchmarks, including the method used by the company. More importantly, we demonstrate explicitly how to associate the predicted probabilities with a loss function in order to make operational decisions in garages. We find that the best choice of job scheduling does not always correspond to the predicted categories, especially when the loss function is asymmetric. We show that scheduling jobs on the basis of our method can help the company reduce loss value.

After receiving a request for quotation, the provider can quote a price for the contract. When the contract is awarded, the profit depends on the quoted price. To gain such contracts and make profit, service providers have to make an accurate estimation of the value of the contract. Therefore, it is crucial to collect attributes from multiple sources that improve the knowledge about the specific contract. However, due to time and effort investment, it is preferred to collect this information in a smart and dynamic way, i.e., responsive to the available collected information. This paper introduces a model of optimal information acquisition for profit maximization that can be used for such situations. Moreover, we introduce a specific model refinement that can be used for quotation optimization. The model utilizes a function that includes the information attributes as variables and returns the profit. Each piece of information is modelled as an attribute for which the true value can be retrieved and the corresponding retrieval effort is translated in a cost. We introduce three heuristic policies with different levels of dynamism for the order and the number of information attributes to be retrieved. We find out that fixing the order in which attributes are retrieved decreases the expected profit by only 4%, while also fixing the number of attributes has much worse consequences.","('Decision processes', 'Dynamic programming', 'Information acquisition', 'Maintenance', 'Quotation optimization')",inform acquisit servic contract quotat made repair shop the author s compon mainten repair overhaul often perform long term servic agreement servic provid after receiv request quotat provid quot price contract when contract award profit depend quot price to gain contract make profit servic provid make accur estim valu contract therefor crucial collect attribut multipl sourc improv knowledg specif contract howev due time effort invest prefer collect inform smart dynam way i e respons avail collect inform this paper introduc model optim inform acquisit profit maxim use situat moreov introduc specif model refin use quotat optim the model util function includ inform attribut variabl return profit each piec inform model attribut true valu retriev correspond retriev effort translat cost we introduc three heurist polici differ level dynam order number inform attribut retriev we find fix order attribut retriev decreas expect profit also fix number attribut much wors consequ decis process dynam program inform acquisit mainten quotat optim

To avoid such downtime costs, companies seek to initiate maintenance just before failure. Unfortunately, this is challenging for the following two reasons: On the one hand, because asset failures are notoriously difficult to predict, even in the presence of real-time monitoring devices which signal early degradation. On the other hand, because the available resources to serve a network of geographically dispersed assets are typically limited. In this paper, we propose a novel model referred to as the dynamic traveling maintainer problem with alerts that incorporates these two challenges and we provide three solution approaches on how to dispatch the limited resources. Namely, we propose: (i) Greedy heuristic approaches that rank assets on urgency, proximity and economic risk; (ii) A novel traveling maintainer heuristic approach that optimizes short-term costs; and (iii) A deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that optimizes long-term costs. Each approach has different requirements concerning the available alert information. Experiments with small asset networks show that all methods can approximate the optimal policy when given access to complete condition information. For larger networks, the proposed methods yield competitive policies, with DRL consistently achieving the lowest costs.","('Decision process', 'Deep reinforcement learning', 'Degradation process', 'Maintenance', 'Traveling maintainer problem')",polici dynam travel maintain problem alert the authorsdowntim industri asset wind turbin medic imag devic come sharp cost to avoid downtim cost compani seek initi mainten failur unfortun challeng follow two reason on one hand asset failur notori difficult predict even presenc real time monitor devic signal earli degrad on hand avail resourc serv network geograph dispers asset typic limit in paper propos novel model refer dynam travel maintain problem alert incorpor two challeng provid three solut approach dispatch limit resourc name propos i greedi heurist approach rank asset urgenc proxim econom risk ii a novel travel maintain heurist approach optim short term cost iii a deep reinforc learn drl approach optim long term cost each approach differ requir concern avail alert inform experi small asset network show method approxim optim polici given access complet condit inform for larger network propos method yield competit polici drl consist achiev lowest cost decis process deep reinforc learn degrad process mainten travel maintain problem

Problems such as the selection of the HMM model by choosing the appropriate number of states, or problems of prediction of failures have not been widely covered in the literature. This paper is concerned with the use of HMMs where the state of the system is not directly observable and instead certain indicators of the true situation are provided via a control system. A hidden model can provide key information about the system dependability such as the failed component of the system, the reliability of the system and related measures.

Such systems often have to ensure high levels of reliability and availability. The deterioration rates of the units typically depend on their production rates, implying that the operator can control deterioration by dynamically reallocating load among units. In this study, we examine the value of condition-based load-sharing decisions for two-unit systems with economic dependency. We formulate the system as a Markov decision process and provide optimal joint condition-based maintenance and production policies. Our numerical results show that, dependent on the system characteristics, substantial cost savings of up to 40% can be realized compared to the optimal condition-based maintenance policy under equal load-sharing. The structure of the optimal policy particularly depends on the maintenance setup cost and the penalty that is incurred if the production target is not satisfied. For systems with high setup costs, the clustering of maintenance interventions is improved by synchronizing the deterioration of the units. On the contrary, for low setup costs, the deterioration levels are desynchronized and the maintenance interventions are alternated.","('Condition-based maintenance', 'Condition-based production', 'Economic dependency', 'Load-sharing', 'Maintenance')",joint condit base mainten load share optim two unit system econom depend the author s mani product facil consist multipl function exchang unit equip pump turbin joint use satisfi given product target such system often ensur high level reliabl avail the deterior rate unit typic depend product rate impli oper control deterior dynam realloc load among unit in studi examin valu condit base load share decis two unit system econom depend we formul system markov decis process provid optim joint condit base mainten product polici our numer result show that depend system characterist substanti cost save realiz compar optim condit base mainten polici equal load share the structur optim polici particular depend mainten setup cost penalti incur product target satisfi for system high setup cost cluster mainten intervent improv synchron deterior unit on contrari low setup cost deterior level desynchron mainten intervent altern condit base mainten condit base product econom depend load share mainten

Unlike the traditional CBM formulation that assumes an infinite planning horizon, this paper evaluates the maintenance cost in a finite planning horizon, which is the practical case for most systems. In the proposed CBM policy, both components are periodically inspected and a preventive or corrective replacement might be carried out based on the state of degradation at inspection. The CBM model is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and dynamic programming is used to compute the expected maintenance cost over a finite planning horizon. The expected maintenance cost is minimized with respect to the preventive replacement thresholds for the two components. Unlike an infinite-horizon CBM problem, which leads to a stationary maintenance policy, the optimal policy in the finite-horizon case turns out to be non-stationary in the sense that the optimal actions vary at each inspection epoch. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed model and investigate the influence of economic dependency and correlation between the degradation processes on the optimal maintenance policy. Numerical results show that a higher dependence between the degradation processes actually reduces the maintenance cost, while a higher economic dependence leads to higher preventive replacement thresholds.","('Bivariate gamma process', 'Condition-based maintenance', 'Finite horizon', 'Markov decision process', 'Reliability')",a finit horizon condit base mainten polici two unit system depend degrad process elsevi b v this paper analyz condit base mainten cbm model system two heterogen compon degrad follow bivari gamma process unlik tradit cbm formul assum infinit plan horizon paper evalu mainten cost finit plan horizon practic case system in propos cbm polici compon period inspect prevent correct replac might carri base state degrad inspect the cbm model formul markov decis process mdp dynam program use comput expect mainten cost finit plan horizon the expect mainten cost minim respect prevent replac threshold two compon unlik infinit horizon cbm problem lead stationari mainten polici optim polici finit horizon case turn non stationari sens optim action vari inspect epoch a numer exampl present illustr propos model investig influenc econom depend correl degrad process optim mainten polici numer result show higher depend degrad process actual reduc mainten cost higher econom depend lead higher prevent replac threshold bivari gamma process condit base mainten finit horizon markov decis process reliabl

The allocation of maintenance tasks to maintenance opportunities, also known as the task allocation problem (TAP), is a complex combinatorial problem that needs to be solved daily by maintenance operators. We propose a novel approach capable of efficiently solving the multi-year task allocation problem for a fleet of aircraft in a few minutes. We formulate this problem as a time-constrained variable-sized bin packing problem (TC-VS-BPP), extending the well-known variable-sized bin packing problem (VS-BPP) by adding deadlines, intervals, and arrivals for the repetition of tasks. In particular, we divide the planning horizon into variable size bins to which multidimensional tasks are allocated, subject to available labor power and task deadlines. To solve this problem, we propose a constructive heuristic based on the worst-fit decreasing (WFD) algorithm for TC-VS-BPP. The heuristic is tested and validated using the maintenance data of 45 aircraft from a European airline. Compared with the solution obtained with an approach using an exact method, the proposed heuristic is more than 30% faster for all the test cases discussed with the airline. Most of the cases have optimality gaps below 3%. Even for the extreme case, the optimality gap is still smaller than 5%.","('Aircraft maintenance', 'Bin packing problem', 'Scheduling', 'Task allocation', 'Worst-fit decreasing')",a bin pack approach solv aircraft mainten task alloc problem the authorsthi paper address schedul aircraft mainten task must carri multipl mainten check keep fleet aircraft airworthi the alloc mainten task mainten opportun also known task alloc problem tap complex combinatori problem need solv daili mainten oper we propos novel approach capabl effici solv multi year task alloc problem fleet aircraft minut we formul problem time constrain variabl size bin pack problem tc vs bpp extend well known variabl size bin pack problem vs bpp ad deadlin interv arriv repetit task in particular divid plan horizon variabl size bin multidimension task alloc subject avail labor power task deadlin to solv problem propos construct heurist base worst fit decreas wfd algorithm tc vs bpp the heurist test valid use mainten data aircraft european airlin compar solut obtain approach use exact method propos heurist faster test case discuss airlin most case optim gap even extrem case optim gap still smaller aircraft mainten bin pack problem schedul task alloc worst fit decreas

The scheduling measure is minimum total late work. We show that unlike the classical version (assuming job-specific due-dates), this problem has a polynomial time solution. Then, the problem is extended to allow job rejection. First, an upper bound on the total permitted rejection cost is assumed. Then we study the setting whereby the rejection cost is part of the objective function, which becomes minimizing the sum of total late work and rejection cost. We prove that both versions are NP-hard, and introduce pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming solution algorithms. We then consider a setting in which the machine is not available for some period (e.g., due to maintenance). Again, a pseudo-polynomial dynamic programming is introduced for the (NP-hard) problem of minimizing total late work with generalized due-dates and unavailability period. These dynamic programming algorithms are tested numerically, and proved to perform well on problems of various input parameters. Then, the extension to the weighted case, i.e., the problem of minimizing total weighted late work with generalized due-dates is proved to be NP-hard. Finally, we study a slightly different setting, in which the given due-dates are assigned to jobs, but there is no restriction on their order, i.e., the j-th due-date is not necessarily assigned to the j-th job in the sequence. We show that this problem (known as scheduling assignable due-dates) to minimize total late work is NP-hard as well.","('Generalized due-dates', 'Job rejection', 'Scheduling', 'Single machine', 'Total late work', 'Unavailability period')",minim total late work singl machin general due date elsevi b v we studi singl machin schedul problem general due date the schedul measur minimum total late work we show unlik classic version assum job specif due date problem polynomi time solut then problem extend allow job reject first upper bound total permit reject cost assum then studi set wherebi reject cost part object function becom minim sum total late work reject cost we prove version np hard introduc pseudo polynomi dynam program solut algorithm we consid set machin avail period e g due mainten again pseudo polynomi dynam program introduc np hard problem minim total late work general due date unavail period these dynam program algorithm test numer prove perform well problem various input paramet then extens weight case i e problem minim total weight late work general due date prove np hard final studi slight differ set given due date assign job restrict order i e j th due date necessarili assign j th job sequenc we show problem known schedul assign due date minim total late work np hard well general due date job reject schedul singl machin total late work unavail period

Hence, it cannot be solved using vehicle routing methods. While most formulations for short-term scheduling adopt a continuous-time representation, they often lead to suboptimal solutions because of the dependence on the number of time slots in the grid, which is difficult to predict. Furthermore, some of these formulations have poor linear relaxations due to the presence of inefficient big-M constraints. In this paper, we develop a discrete-time mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the detailed scheduling of a straight pipeline with a single refinery and multiple depots. The proposed formulation rigorously detects interface material generated between adjacent products and considers planned shutdowns in pipeline segments due to maintenance operations, as well as local market demands occurring at multiple intermediate due dates. The main novelty is that continuous tasks can span multiple time slots to enforce minimum batch sizes on injection and delivery nodes, which allows for the model to generate better schedules than those obtained with previously proposed formulations. To ensure an efficient model by design, we rely on generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) and on the convex hull reformulation of disjunctions, which results in stronger and often more computationally efficient formulations. We present numerical results for a set of benchmark instances and show that the proposed model applies to large-scale industrial cases.","('Discrete-time', 'Mixed-integer linear programming', 'Pipeline scheduling', 'Transportation')",effici formul transport schedul singl refineri multiproduct pipelin elsevi b v multiproduct pipelin transport schedul complex oper research problem character movement cargo rather carrier henc cannot solv use vehicl rout method while formul short term schedul adopt continu time represent often lead suboptim solut depend number time slot grid difficult predict furthermor formul poor linear relax due presenc ineffici big m constraint in paper develop discret time mix integ linear program milp model detail schedul straight pipelin singl refineri multipl depot the propos formul rigor detect interfac materi generat adjac product consid plan shutdown pipelin segment due mainten oper well local market demand occur multipl intermedi due date the main novelti continu task span multipl time slot enforc minimum batch size inject deliveri node allow model generat better schedul obtain previous propos formul to ensur effici model design reli general disjunct program gdp convex hull reformul disjunct result stronger often comput effici formul we present numer result set benchmark instanc show propos model appli larg scale industri case discret time mix integ linear program pipelin schedul transport

These infections can cause performance degradation (i.e., a slower service rate) and facilitate data theft, both of which have monetary repercussions. Infections may go undetected and can only be removed by time-consuming cleanup procedures, which require temporarily taking the service offline. From a security-oriented perspective, cleanups should be undertaken as frequently as possible. From a performance-oriented perspective, frequent cleanups are desirable because they maintain faster service, but they are simultaneously undesirable because they lead to more frequent downtimes and subsequent loss of revenue. We ask when and how often cleanups should happen. In order to analyze various downtime scheduling policies, we combine queueing-theoretic techniques with a revenue model to capture the problem's tradeoffs. Unlike classical repair problems, this problem necessitates the analysis of a quasi-birth-death Markov chain, tracking the number of customer requests in the system and the (possibly unknown) infection state. We adapt a recent analytic technique, Clearing Analysis on Phases (CAP), to determine the exact steady-state distribution of the underlying Markov chain, which we then use to compute revenue rates and make recommendations.

We consider situations where performance and condition do not necessarily deteriorate at the same rate typified by, say, an ageing system still achieving good performance or a new system performing poorly. In this problem context, competing interests may arise between different decision-makers, such as operators and maintainers, since alternative strategies may benefit either performance or condition at the expense of the other. To address this challenge we introduce a theoretical framework for the PCM approach and discuss key characteristics of the modelling problem. The general PCM approach is motivated by a real-world industrial system for which maintenance decisions required to be optimised. A specific application is shown for the industry problem which we model by a Markov decision process capable of interrogating decisions over multiple time-scales. We obtain an exact solution using dynamic programming. We also explore a less computationally challenging heuristic using a reinforcement learning algorithm and evaluate its accuracy for the large-scale industry model. We show that optimal maintenance policies from a PCM model can provide decision support to both maintainers and operators taking account of both perspectives of the problem.","('Maintenance', 'Maintenance optimisation', 'Markov decision process', 'Performance-centred maintenance', 'Reinforcement learning')",a perform centr approach optimis mainten complex system the authorsthi paper introduc perform centr mainten pcm novel approach maintain system dual consider given oper perform degrad condit we consid situat perform condit necessarili deterior rate typifi by say age system still achiev good perform new system perform poor in problem context compet interest may aris differ decis maker oper maintain sinc altern strategi may benefit either perform condit expens other to address challeng introduc theoret framework pcm approach discuss key characterist model problem the general pcm approach motiv real world industri system mainten decis requir optimis a specif applic shown industri problem model markov decis process capabl interrog decis multipl time scale we obtain exact solut use dynam program we also explor less comput challeng heurist use reinforc learn algorithm evalu accuraci larg scale industri model we show optim mainten polici pcm model provid decis support maintain oper take account perspect problem mainten mainten optimis markov decis process perform centr mainten reinforc learn

In these organisations, spare part inventory management is a crucial issue. Two key aspects set contexts such as the defence sector apart. First, shipment times between secondary warehouses are longer than shipment times between the main warehouse and any given secondary warehouse. Second, the cost of the shipment is fixed, so each new delivery incurs no extra cost. To investigate such a scenario, this study examines how best to redistribute stock amongst several secondary warehouses in a two-echelon network. The supply response time for spare parts due to backorders must be minimised to maximise the fleet's operational availability. For each spare part, the goal is to find the optimal allocation to each warehouse to minimise the expected waiting time in repair shops. A stochastic redistribution model is developed. Extensive numerical examples from real cases in Spanish Army are used to demonstrate the model's effectiveness. The results are satisfactory in terms of the number of positive cases, the reduction in waiting days and solution accuracy. The approach is valid in most cases, and it is particularly suitable in situations with non-negligible transport times where the organisation's own vehicles ply regular routes. The model is designed for the defence sector, thereby tackling a real problem, although it is equally applicable to other maintenance, repair and overhaul environments with similar characteristics.

Decisions on whether to replace the deteriorated components are made based on the statuses of components and the system and are further restricted by the inventory level of spares. Inventory replenishment decisions themselves depend both on system status and maintenance policy. Both maintenance and replenishment decisions affect the system reliability and system maintenance and spare inventory cost. This paper considers the joint optimization of periodic condition-based replacement of components and inventory control for a k-out-of-n:F system of non-repairable degrading components under various system statuses. For modeling the degradation of components, both the Wiener process and gamma process are considered. We model the maintenance and inventory policy using the number of components in each discretized degradation state rather than the traditional approach, which uses the state of each component. Our approach considerably reduces the solution space.

To guarantee profitability, the service fees should at least cover the expected costs during the contract horizon.

The proposed solution method is based on the Large Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic. The efficiency of the proposed metaheuristic is validated against state of the art algorithms. The results obtained from the computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, as the maintenance activities are affected by uncertain conditions, a simulation-based optimisation algorithm is developed to tackle these uncertainties. This algorithm benefits from the fast computational time and solution quality of the proposed metaheuristic, combined with Monte Carlo simulation. The uncertain factors considered include the travel time for a vessel to visit turbines, the required time to maintain a turbine, and the transfer time for technicians and equipment to a turbine. Moreover, the proposed simulation-based optimisation algorithm is devised to tackle unpredictable broken-down turbines.

Motivated by an industrial application problem, we formulate the hydropower maintenance scheduling problem as a two-stage stochastic program, and we implement a parallelized Benders decomposition algorithm for its solution. We obtain convex subproblems by approximating the hydroelectricity production using linear inequalities and indicator variables, which account for the nonlinear effect of the number of active generators in the solution. For speeding up the execution of our decomposition algorithm, we tailor and test seven techniques, including three new applications of special ordered sets, presolve and warm start for Benders acceleration. Given the large number of possible configurations of these acceleration techniques, we illustrate the application of statistical methods and computational experiments to identify the best performing configuration, which achieved a fourfold speedup of the decomposition algorithm.

Due to the independence among all the subproblems after the decomposition, the algorithm is amenable to parallel computing, which leads to faster convergence as demonstrated in the numerical results.

The intrinsic degradation of each component is modelled with a pure jump Lévy process. The idea of the failure dependence is motivated by complex engineering systems where the failure of one component may cause a momentary, transient shock to the system. The effect of the shock is modelled by a random magnitude of increment in the degradation level of each surviving component. Perfect periodic inspections are carried out on the system. Upon inspection, highly deteriorated or failed components are perfectly replaced and hence are restored to an as-good-as-new state. Nothing is done to the rest of the components. For such a system, the evaluation of the reliability and the assessment of the maintenance planning are quite complex due to the failure dependence as well as the imperfect maintenance at the system level. In this study, we address these problems by the implementation of Markov renewal theory. The maintenances costs in both the short-run and long-run horizons are derived and we validate these theoretical calculations by Monte-carlo simulations.

From a warrantor's perspective, the design and pricing problem is to determine which candidate options to offer and the associated prices so as to maximize the expected warranty profit. We show that the optimal strategy is to offer all candidate options associated with a cost-plus-margin pricing policy, with the same profit margins for all options. If only a limited number of options can be offered, then the options with the highest valuation margins should be selected. In addition, we present three extended models by incorporating heterogeneous warranty breadths, free preventive maintenance programs, and customers with heterogeneous perceptions of product failure probability. Major findings in the extended models include: (i) a free preventive maintenance program should be attached to a warranty option only when it is feasible for that option; and (ii) when the customer population is heterogeneous, the equal-margin pricing policy is no longer optimal.

This study introduces a general framework that simultaneously and optimally selects and schedules urban road projects subject to budgetary constraints over a given planning horizon. The project classes considered in this study are lane addition, new road construction, and road maintenance. Through a mimicry of the classic Stackelberg leader-follower game, this problem is formulated herein as a bi-level program. In the upper level, the leader (transport agency decision-makers) determines an optimal set of projects from a larger pool of candidate projects and decides an optimal schedule for their implementation. In the lower level, the followers (road users) seek to minimize their travel delays based on the two decisions made by the leader in the upper level. The numerical experiments show that if the decision-makers do not consider the peri-implementation capacity reduction, the resulting set of selected projects and their construction schedule can lead to significant travel delay cost for the road users.","('Active-set algorithm', 'Bi-level program', 'Project scheduling', 'Project selection', 'Transport')",optim select schedul multi class project use stackelberg framework elsevi b v one major caus non recurr traffic congest urban area implement transport infrastructur project citi road the seem ubiqu work zone citi caus road user frustrat safeti hazard public relat problem transport agenc for reason transport agenc seek strateg way select urban project also schedul manner minim effort associ function in word seek exploit synergi task project select project schedul duli accommod project interdepend this studi introduc general framework simultan optim select schedul urban road project subject budgetari constraint given plan horizon the project class consid studi lane addit new road construct road mainten through mimicri classic stackelberg leader follow game problem formul herein bi level program in upper level leader transport agenc decis maker determin optim set project larger pool candid project decid optim schedul implement in lower level follow road user seek minim travel delay base two decis made leader upper level the numer experi show decis maker consid peri implement capac reduct result set select project construct schedul lead signific travel delay cost road user activ set algorithm bi level program project schedul project select transport

To address this challenge, the operators of such equipment often purchase business interruption (BI) insurance to mitigate operational risks. In this paper, we develop a principal-agent model to study an after-sales service contracting problem with an insurance option. Two prevailing contract forms are considered: a resource-based contract (RBC) and a performance-based contract (PBC). We first show that, in the presence of insurance, a PBC outperforms an RBC in terms of system performance due to the skewed incentives inherent in an RBC. More important, our results show that insurance plays contrasting roles in incentivizing a service supplier under the two contracting mechanisms. Under an RBC, insurance improves the service supplier's effort provision and hence benefits the operator because insurance provides a risk-sharing mechanism that better aligns the incentives of the service supplier and the operator. Under a PBC, although the supplier's equilibrium effort remains at the first-best level regardless of the insurance coverage level, the use of insurance changes the operator's optimal contract and the risk allocation between the operator and the supplier. Our findings provide important insights into the interplay of insurance and contract incentives in an after-sales service context.","('After-sales service', 'Contract and incentives', 'Insurance', 'Maintenance')",contract design equip after sale servic busi interrupt insur elsevi b v after sale servic strateg import mission critic equip due high oper risk involv e g machin breakdown to address challeng oper equip often purchas busi interrupt bi insur mitig oper risk in paper develop princip agent model studi after sale servic contract problem insur option two prevail contract form consid resourc base contract rbc perform base contract pbc we first show that presenc insur pbc outperform rbc term system perform due skew incent inher rbc more import result show insur play contrast role incentiv servic supplier two contract mechan under rbc insur improv servic supplier s effort provis henc benefit oper insur provid risk share mechan better align incent servic supplier oper under pbc although supplier s equilibrium effort remain first best level regardless insur coverag level use insur chang oper s optim contract risk alloc oper supplier our find provid import insight interplay insur contract incent after sale servic context after sale servic contract incent insur mainten

Conventional machine learning requires data that is representative of the feature-target relationship and relies on the often costly development, maintenance, and revision of handcrafted features. Consequently, modeling highly variable, heterogeneous patterns such as trader behavior is challenging. Deep learning promises a remedy. Learning hierarchical distributed representations of the data in an automatic manner (e.g. risk taking behavior), it uncovers generative features that determine the target (e.g., trader's profitability), avoids manual feature engineering, and is more robust toward change (e.g. dynamic market conditions). The results of employing a deep network for operational risk forecasting confirm the feature learning capability of deep learning, provide guidance on designing a suitable network architecture and demonstrate the superiority of deep learning over machine learning and rule-based benchmarks.","('Deep learning', 'Forecasting', 'Retail finance', 'Risk management')",can deep learn predict riski retail investor a case studi financi risk behavior forecast elsevi b v the paper examin potenti deep learn support decis financi risk manag we develop deep learn model predict whether individu spread trader secur profit futur trade this task embodi typic model challeng face risk behavior forecast convent machin learn requir data repres featur target relationship reli often cost develop mainten revis handcraft featur consequ model high variabl heterogen pattern trader behavior challeng deep learn promis remedi learn hierarch distribut represent data automat manner e g risk take behavior uncov generat featur determin target e g trader s profit avoid manual featur engin robust toward chang e g dynam market condit the result employ deep network oper risk forecast confirm featur learn capabl deep learn provid guidanc design suitabl network architectur demonstr superior deep learn machin learn rule base benchmark deep learn forecast retail financ risk manag

Most of the reported works on selective maintenance have been dedicated to maximizing the success of a single future mission. Cases of multiple consecutive missions, which are oftentimes encountered in engineering practices, have been rarely investigated to date. In this paper, a new selective maintenance optimization for multi-state systems that can execute multiple consecutive missions over a finite horizon is developed. The selective maintenance strategy can be dynamically optimized to maximize the expected number of future mission successes whenever the states and effective ages of the components become known at the end of the last mission. The dynamic optimization problem, which accounts for imperfect maintenance, is formulated as a discrete-time finite-horizon Markov decision process with a mixed integer-discrete-continuous state space. Based on the framework of actor-critic algorithms, a customized deep reinforcement learning method is put forth to overcome the “curse of dimensionality” and mitigate the uncountable state space. In our proposed method, a postprocess is developed for the actor to search the optimal maintenance actions in a large-scale discrete action space, whereas the techniques of the experience replay and the target network are utilized to facilitate the agent training. The performance of the proposed method is examined by an illustrative example and an engineering example of a coal transportation system.","('Deep reinforcement learning', 'Dynamic selective maintenance', 'Imperfect maintenance', 'Maintenance', 'Multi-state system')",dynam select mainten optim multi state system finit horizon a deep reinforc learn approach elsevi b v select mainten aim choos subset feasibl mainten action perform repair system limit mainten resourc extens studi past decad most report work select mainten dedic maxim success singl futur mission case multipl consecut mission oftentim encount engin practic rare investig date in paper new select mainten optim multi state system execut multipl consecut mission finit horizon develop the select mainten strategi dynam optim maxim expect number futur mission success whenev state effect age compon becom known end last mission the dynam optim problem account imperfect mainten formul discret time finit horizon markov decis process mix integ discret continu state space base framework actor critic algorithm custom deep reinforc learn method put forth overcom curs dimension mitig uncount state space in propos method postprocess develop actor search optim mainten action larg scale discret action space wherea techniqu experi replay target network util facilit agent train the perform propos method examin illustr exampl engin exampl coal transport system deep reinforc learn dynam select mainten imperfect mainten mainten multi state system

Owing to equipment failures and maintenance requirements, the capacities of edges have several states. Such systems are regarded as multi-state flow networks (MSFN). System reliability of an MSFN is the probability that the required flow (i.e., demand) can successfully be sent from the source to the sink. By adopting a minimal path (MP) approach, system reliability can be computed in terms of all minimal capacity vectors meeting the demand d. A minimal capacity vector is called a d-MP. Although several algorithms have been presented in the literature for finding all d-MP, improving efficiency in the search for all d-MP is always a challenge. A group approach with both the concepts of minimal cut and MP is developed in this study, narrowing the search range of feasible flow vectors. An algorithm based on the group approach is then proposed to improve the efficiency of the d-MP search. According to the structure of the proposed algorithm, parallel computing can be implemented with significant improvement in the efficiency of the d-MP generation, where the proposed algorithm is compared with previous ones based on three benchmarks, in terms of CPU time.","('d-MP', 'Minimal cuts', 'Multi-state flow network', 'Parallel computing', 'Reliability')",a novel minim cut base algorithm find minim capac vector multi state flow network elsevi b v real system comput system model network topolog vertic edg owe equip failur mainten requir capac edg sever state such system regard multi state flow network msfn system reliabl msfn probabl requir flow i e demand success sent sourc sink by adopt minim path mp approach system reliabl comput term minim capac vector meet demand d a minim capac vector call d mp although sever algorithm present literatur find d mp improv effici search d mp alway challeng a group approach concept minim cut mp develop studi narrow search rang feasibl flow vector an algorithm base group approach propos improv effici d mp search accord structur propos algorithm parallel comput implement signific improv effici d mp generat propos algorithm compar previous one base three benchmark term cpu time d mp minim cut multi state flow network parallel comput reliabl

When required to efficiently allocate a set of geographically distributed tasks to a maintenance engineering workforce, one approach is to define working areas for which teams of engineers are responsible. Often a key obstacle to overcome when looking for solutions is ensuring a balance between multiple competing objectives.

We provide a detailed analysis of the class of problems to be solved, where the workforce and a set of service distribution points must be split into smaller working areas, referred to as operational units. As the choice of how many operational units to split a larger working area into is critical, some of the practical considerations that must be made when addressing such problems are highlighted.

However, item owners may be unpunctual, causing actual maintenance instants deviating from scheduled instants. This paper studies the impact of customer unpunctuality on the optimization of PM policy and the resultant warranty expenses. An unpunctual imperfect PM policy, which allows customers to advance or postpone scheduled PM activities in a tolerated range, is proposed for repairable items sold with a two-dimensional warranty. The expected total warranty costs of the unpunctual (and punctual) PM policies are derived under the assumption that customer unpunctuality is governed by a specific probability distribution. The optimization and comparison of the two policies are investigated in different scenarios regarding the product's failure rate function. The results for two possible unpunctuality distributions—uniform and triangular—are discussed and compared. Numerical studies show that the expected total warranty cost of the unpunctual policy could be either higher or lower than that of the punctual policy, depending on customer behaviors and the shape of failure rate function. Accordingly, manufacturers could induce customers to adjust their unpunctuality behaviors by modifying PM policies or introducing penalty/bonus mechanisms.","('Customer unpunctuality', 'Finite horizon', 'Imperfect preventive maintenance', 'Reliability', 'Two-dimensional warranty')",an unpunctu prevent mainten polici two dimension warranti elsevi b v in busi to consum context e g automobil industri prevent mainten pm warrant item usual reli upon custom return item author mainten center accord prescrib schedul howev item owner may unpunctu caus actual mainten instant deviat schedul instant this paper studi impact custom unpunctu optim pm polici result warranti expens an unpunctu imperfect pm polici allow custom advanc postpon schedul pm activ toler rang propos repair item sold two dimension warranti the expect total warranti cost unpunctu and punctual pm polici deriv assumpt custom unpunctu govern specif probabl distribut the optim comparison two polici investig differ scenario regard product s failur rate function the result two possibl unpunctu distribut uniform triangular are discuss compar numer studi show expect total warranti cost unpunctu polici could either higher lower punctual polici depend custom behavior shape failur rate function accord manufactur could induc custom adjust unpunctu behavior modifi pm polici introduc penalti bonus mechan custom unpunctu finit horizon imperfect prevent mainten reliabl two dimension warranti

In this review we present an overview of Bayesian methods to solve decision problems in reliability some of which involve two or more decision makers with conflicting objectives. We consider problems in areas such as design, life testing, preventive maintenance, reliability certification, or warranty policies. In doing so, we present key aspects of the decision problems, give a brief review of earlier methods and finally discuss recent advances in Bayesian approaches to solve them.","('Adversarial risk analysis', 'Design of life tests', 'Optimal replacement', 'Reliability', 'Warranties')",advanc bayesian decis make reliabl elsevi b v start late s bayesian method gain increas attent reliabl literatur the focus earlier bayesian work reliabl involv statist infer thus main emphasi model analysi advanc bayesian comput s signific contribut use bayesian infer predict also implement bayesian decis theoret approach reliabl problem in review present overview bayesian method solv decis problem reliabl involv two decis maker conflict object we consid problem area design life test prevent mainten reliabl certif warranti polici in so present key aspect decis problem give brief review earlier method final discuss recent advanc bayesian approach solv them adversari risk analysi design life test optim replac reliabl warranti

This problem-based research has identified a framework of methods to supplement the operations research/management science literature by contributing a hybrid simulation-based optimization framework (HSBOF), extending previously reported research. Overall, it is the application of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with system dynamics (SD) and discrete-event simulation (DES) respectively which allows maintenance activities to be pinpointed in the production system based on analyzes generating less reactive work load on the maintenance organization. Therefore, the application of the HSBOF informs practice by a multiphase process, where each phase builds knowledge, starting with exploring feedback behaviors to why certain near-optimal maintenance behaviors arise, forming the basis of potential performance improvements, subsequently optimized using DES+MOO in a standard software, prioritizing the sequence of improvements in the production system for maintenance to implement. Studying literature on related hybridizations using optimization the proposed work can be considered novel, being based on SD+MOO industrial cases and their application to a DES+MOO software.","('Decision support', 'Discrete-event simulation', 'Multi-objective optimization', 'Problem structuring', 'System dynamics')",a hybrid simul base optim framework support strateg mainten develop improv product perform elsevi b v manag mainten impact busi result increas complex call advanc oper research methodolog address challeng sustain decis make this problem base research identifi framework method supplement oper research manag scienc literatur contribut hybrid simul base optim framework hsbof extend previous report research overal applic multi object optim moo system dynam sd discret event simul des respect allow mainten activ pinpoint product system base analyz generat less reactiv work load mainten organ therefor applic hsbof inform practic multiphas process phase build knowledg start explor feedback behavior certain near optim mainten behavior aris form basi potenti perform improv subsequ optim use des moo standard softwar priorit sequenc improv product system mainten implement studi literatur relat hybrid use optim propos work consid novel base sd moo industri case applic des moo softwar decis support discret event simul multi object optim problem structur system dynam

It is the first time that the long-term aircraft maintenance check schedule is optimized, integrating different check types in a single schedule solution. The proposed methodology aims at minimizing the wasted interval between checks. By achieving this goal, one is also reducing the number of checks over time, increasing aircraft availability and, therefore, reducing maintenance costs, while respecting safety regulations. The model formulation takes aircraft type, status, maintenance capacity, and other operational constraints into consideration. We also validate and demonstrate the proposed methodology using fleet maintenance data from a European airline. The outcomes show that, when compared with the current practice, the number of maintenance checks can be reduced by around 7% over a period of 4 years, while computation time is less than 15 minutes. This could result in saving worth $1.1M–$3.4M in maintenance costs for a fleet of about 40 aircraft and generating more than $9.8M of revenue due to higher aircraft availability.","('Aircraft maintenance', 'Dynamic programming', 'Forward induction', 'Scheduling')",a practic dynam program base methodolog aircraft mainten check schedul optim elsevi b v this paper present practic dynam program base methodolog optim long term mainten check schedul fleet heterogen aircraft it first time long term aircraft mainten check schedul optim integr differ check type singl schedul solut the propos methodolog aim minim wast interv check by achiev goal one also reduc number check time increas aircraft avail and therefor reduc mainten cost respect safeti regul the model formul take aircraft type status mainten capac oper constraint consider we also valid demonstr propos methodolog use fleet mainten data european airlin the outcom show that compar current practic number mainten check reduc around period year comput time less minut this could result save worth m m mainten cost fleet aircraft generat m revenu due higher aircraft avail aircraft mainten dynam program forward induct schedul

The partial repair is assumed dependent on the past in the sense that it cannot bring the system back into a deterioration state better than the one reached at the last repair. Such a past-dependency can affect (i) the selection of a type of maintenance actions, (ii) the maintenance duration, (iii) the deterioration level after a maintenance, and (iv) the restarting system deterioration behavior. In this paper, all these effects are jointly considered in an unifying condition-based maintenance model on the basis of restarting deterioration states randomly sampled from a probability distribution truncated by the deterioration levels just before a current repair and just after the last repair/replacement. Using results from the semi-regenerative theory, the long-run maintenance cost rate is analytically derived.

The models we develop are interesting because they mimic realities in which production is prioritised over maintenance, so that inspections might be impeded or they might be opportunistic. Random maintenance has been modelled by others but there is little in the literature that relates to inspection of a critical system. We suppose that the critical system can be good, defective or failed, and that failure impacts on production, so that a failure is immediately revealed, but a defect does not. A defect, if revealed at inspection, is a trigger for replacement. We compare the cost and reliability of random inspections with scheduled periodic inspections and discuss the implications for practice. Our results indicate that inspections that are performed opportunistically rather than scheduled periodically may offer an economic advantage provided opportunities are sufficiently frequent and convenient. A hybrid inspection and replacement policy, with inspections subject to impediments, is robust to departure from its inspection schedule.","('Maintenance', 'Production', 'Quality', 'Random inspection', 'Reliability')",delay time model critic system subject random inspect elsevi b v we model inspect mainten critic system execut inspect random the model develop interest mimic realiti product prioritis mainten inspect might imped might opportunist random mainten model other littl literatur relat inspect critic system we suppos critic system good defect fail failur impact product failur immedi reveal defect not a defect reveal inspect trigger replac we compar cost reliabl random inspect schedul period inspect discuss implic practic our result indic inspect perform opportunist rather schedul period may offer econom advantag provid opportun suffici frequent conveni a hybrid inspect replac polici inspect subject impedi robust departur inspect schedul mainten product qualiti random inspect reliabl

Often, there is flexibility to delay planned, preventive maintenance when spare parts are required to perform more urgent unplanned, corrective maintenance. In this case, keeping a single stock of inventory to satisfy both types of demand can be beneficial. Therefore, we study a periodic review inventory system with a single stocking point and a zero replenishment lead time, used to meet lower-priority demands that are planned, as well as stochastic, high-priority demands. We study the impact of flexibility in performing planned maintenance on the optimal inventory policy. When planned maintenance may be delayed at most once, i.e., for one period, a myopic policy is optimal. When it may be delayed to the next period for an unlimited number of times, we characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We further propose two extensions, one in which delayed planned maintenance may become unplanned and one in which the total maintenance delay costs are increasing and convex in the number of delayed maintenance actions. Numerically, we find that allowing a single delay provides a system performance very close to that when unlimited delays are allowed. This result becomes even stronger in the context of the two model extensions. These results are important for practice, since maintenance managers are unlikely to accept the unlimited delay policy, while the one delay policy is likely to be more acceptable. Finally, we develop myopic heuristic policies and demonstrate that they perform quite close to optimal.","('Inventory', 'Maintenance flexibility', 'Spare parts')",the valu mainten delay flexibl improv spare part inventori manag elsevi b v capit asset typic maintain replac compon spare part often flexibl delay plan prevent mainten spare part requir perform urgent unplan correct mainten in case keep singl stock inventori satisfi type demand benefici therefor studi period review inventori system singl stock point zero replenish lead time use meet lower prioriti demand plan well stochast high prioriti demand we studi impact flexibl perform plan mainten optim inventori polici when plan mainten may delay onc i e one period myopic polici optim when may delay next period unlimit number time character structur optim polici we propos two extens one delay plan mainten may becom unplan one total mainten delay cost increas convex number delay mainten action numer find allow singl delay provid system perform close unlimit delay allow this result becom even stronger context two model extens these result import practic sinc mainten manag unlik accept unlimit delay polici one delay polici like accept final develop myopic heurist polici demonstr perform quit close optim inventori mainten flexibl spare part

Due to the volatility of real circumstances, stochastic optimization methods are needed to aid decisions on reliability design and maintenance for the high-consequence systems. Traditionally, risk-neutral approaches are used by considering the expectation of random variables as a preference criterion. The risk-neutral approaches may achieve the solutions that are good in the long run but do not control poor results under certain realizations of random variables. From a perspective of risk analysis, such solutions are not acceptable for high-consequence systems. To address this issue, this paper uses the conditional value at risk (CVaR) to more properly account for some of the worst realizations of random future usage scenarios, and then proposes a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming model to simultaneously determine the numbers of components in each subsystem and preventive maintenance time intervals for the high-consequence systems that are exposed to uncertain future usage stresses. The proposed stochastic programming model can be converted to a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. To solve the model, we derive the analytical properties of the recourse function and the closed form of CVaR and then design a decomposition algorithm. Numerical examples demonstrate the proposed risk-averse stochastic approach and the effectiveness of incorporating the CVaR in modeling. The results show the research problem significantly benefits from the proposed approach. Furthermore, the robustness of the optimal system design and maintenance plan under different profiles of future usage scenarios is addressed.","('Preventive maintenance', 'Redundancy allocation', 'Reliability', 'Risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming', 'Uncertain future usage stresses')",a risk avers stochast program integr system design prevent mainten plan elsevi b v the failur high consequ system highspe railway result seri sever damag due volatil real circumst stochast optim method need aid decis reliabl design mainten high consequ system tradit risk neutral approach use consid expect random variabl prefer criterion the risk neutral approach may achiev solut good long run control poor result certain realize random variabl from perspect risk analysi solut accept high consequ system to address issu paper use condit valu risk cvar proper account worst realize random futur usag scenario propos risk avers two stage stochast program model simultan determin number compon subsystem prevent mainten time interv high consequ system expos uncertain futur usag stress the propos stochast program model convert nonconvex mix integ nonlinear program minlp model to solv model deriv analyt properti recours function close form cvar design decomposit algorithm numer exampl demonstr propos risk avers stochast approach effect incorpor cvar model the result show research problem signific benefit propos approach furthermor robust optim system design mainten plan differ profil futur usag scenario address prevent mainten redund alloc reliabl risk avers two stage stochast program uncertain futur usag stress

We propose a two-stage stochastic programming (SP) model of the problem where the first stage decisions are what vessels to charter. The second stage decisions are how to support maintenance tasks using the chartered vessels from the first stage, given uncertainty in weather conditions and the occurrence of failures. To solve the resulting SP model we perform an ad-hoc Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition where, unlike standard decomposition approaches for SP models, parts of the second stage problem remain in the master problem. The decomposed model is then solved as a matheuristic by apriori generating a subset of the possible extreme points from the Dantzig–Wolfe subproblems.

Then, results from in-sample and out-of-sample stability tests are presented to verify that the matheuristic gives stable results.

When the degradation behavior is significantly affected by environments, a single stochastic process is not suitable to describe the system degrading in different environments any more. In this paper, a model is developed for systems degrading in dynamic environments subject to several imperfect maintenance actions before each replacement, in which the degradation of the system within different environments is governed by different stochastic processes. The evolution of the environments is described by a Markov process. To describe the system performance, system availabilities including instantaneous availability and limiting average availability, and some time distributions of interest are some important indexes which are derived in the paper. Then the problem of optimal maintenance policy is formulated by considering constraints of availability and operating times. The objective of the optimal maintenance policy is to find an optimal number of imperfect maintenance actions between two adjacent replacements. The existence of the optimal solution is proved and the algorithm of calculation is also presented. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the results obtained in the paper.","('Dynamic environments', 'Maintenance', 'Markov process', 'Optimal maintenance policy', 'System degradation')",avail optim mainten polici system degrad dynam environ elsevi b v in engin practic theori system degrad often model stochast process when degrad behavior signific affect environ singl stochast process suitabl describ system degrad differ environ more in paper model develop system degrad dynam environ subject sever imperfect mainten action replac degrad system within differ environ govern differ stochast process the evolut environ describ markov process to describ system perform system avail includ instantan avail limit averag avail time distribut interest import index deriv paper then problem optim mainten polici formul consid constraint avail oper time the object optim mainten polici find optim number imperfect mainten action two adjac replac the exist optim solut prove algorithm calcul also present numer exampl given illustr result obtain paper dynam environ mainten markov process optim mainten polici system degrad

The maintenance policy consists of two phases: imperfect maintenance phase followed by postponed replacement phase. In the imperfect maintenance phase, inspection is performed to reveal the defective state, leading to a possible repair. Both the inspection and the repair are imperfect. In the postponed replacement phase, preventive replacement is performed during the upcoming scheduled maintenance window, before which no inspection or repair is executed. The expected net revenue under PBC is maximized via the joint optimization of the inspection interval, number of inspection and preventive replacement interval.

We compare the two policies in a monopolistic setting when a firm uses either one of the policies, and when both policies are used by a single firm. We then compare the policies under competition first when two firms use identical products, and when two firms use vertically differentiated products. Our findings indicate that the selling option dominates the installed base option in a monopolistic environment, even for significant values of remanufacturing savings from the installed base policy. In a competitive environment, if two firms use identical products, we find that the two firms use only differentiated pure strategies (where one firm uses installed base management and the other uses selling), or the outcome is a mixed equilibrium, where each firm uses each pure strategy with a certain probability. We find that the firm using the installed base management policy in the duopoly with identical products performs better than the firm using the selling policy. In a competitive market where both firms use vertically differentiated products, we find that both firms can use both mechanisms of installed base management and selling in equilibrium. However, we find that the profits from the installed base segments of the two firms are higher than the profits from the selling segments.

With the advances in modern sensor and wireless communication technologies, service providers can monitor the health status of each product in use and then conduct condition-based maintenance accordingly. Meanwhile, the waste of the remaining life of replaced products should also be considered in the system's operation due to the increasing concerns about environmental impact and lean production. To improve the profitability of a Use-Oriented Product Service System, we formulate a discrete-time Markov Decision Process that maximizes the long-term revenue per period. To overcome the computational challenge of this problem, we propose a sequential heuristic solution incorporating a heuristic replacement policy along with a heuristic inventory control approach to solve the integrated model. The heuristic replacement policy is derived from the optimal control policy for the subsystem of a single customer. The inventory control heuristic determines the target inventory level according to a one-period look-ahead myopic optimization policy. The performance of the proposed solution and some useful management insights are investigated in a numerical study.

The problem pursues the finding of a maintenance schedule that incurs minimum total fixed and variable cost. Each executed maintenance activity guarantees the operability of the respective component for an interval of predetermined length. Moreover, a feasible schedule has to obey period-dependent predetermined time limitations for the scheduled maintenance activities. After providing a literature classification of the WCPMP and proving that the unweighted CPMP is strongly NP-hard, the complexity status of further problem variants is established. For instance, a solution procedure is proposed for the WCPMP that guarantees an optimal solution in strongly-polynomial time if the number of maintenance activities is a constant. Moreover, the algorithm becomes pseudo-polynomial if the number of periods is a constant. In order to deal with strongly NP-hard variants, a multi-state Tabu Search approach is proposed.

The activities can revert the machine from a sub-normal processing rate to a normal one. In this paper, we study a single machine scheduling problem where deteriorating jobs and flexible periodic maintenance are considered. The single machine is operated to process a set of jobs with alternating processing periods and maintenance periods. In a processing period, a subset of jobs is sequentially processed and the completion time of the last job cannot exceed the allowed maximum duration. The actual processing time of each job grows at a linear job-specific deterioration rate and depends on its starting time within the period. Between two processing periods, a maintenance period with a fixed duration exists and the maintenance activities are carried out so that the processing rate of the machine is reverted to the normal rate. The objective is to schedule all the jobs to a set of processing periods and to minimize the makespan of the schedule. We formulate the problem using a set-partitioning model and, for a solution method, we make use of a branch-and-price algorithm.

The system repair times and the replenishment times of the spare parts inventory are also exponentially distributed. The inventory replenishment is done according to a Base-Stock policy. The objective is to minimize the total system cost consisting of annual holding costs of the spare parts and the service engineers, and incidental outsourcing costs. For the joint optimization of the resources, we propose a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulation using the balance equations of the Markov Chain representation of the system. Furthermore, we provide a simple and efficient heuristic that produces close-to-optimal (< 0.3% difference) results, for solving larger instances. Using the proposed optimization methods and real-life data, we analyze the optimal balance between the costs of the resources and the outsourcing costs and show how the outsourcing rates and the total costs behave for different system parameters.","('Maintenance', 'Markov process', 'Mixed-integer programming', 'Service engineers', 'Spare Parts')",joint plan servic engin spare part elsevi b v we analyz joint optim spare part inventori workforc alloc singl site mainten system in system failur servic engin necessari replac part alloc if one requir resourc avail incom failur request rout extern provid central repair facil sub contractor we studi multipl failur type relat fail compon exponenti distribut inter failur time the system repair time replenish time spare part inventori also exponenti distribut the inventori replenish done accord base stock polici the object minim total system cost consist annual hold cost spare part servic engin incident outsourc cost for joint optim resourc propos mix integ program mip formul use balanc equat markov chain represent system furthermor provid simpl effici heurist produc close to optim differ result solv larger instanc use propos optim method real life data analyz optim balanc cost resourc outsourc cost show outsourc rate total cost behav differ system paramet mainten markov process mix integ program servic engin spare part

We propose a novel hybrid framework using Constraint Programming to generate initial feasible solutions to feed as ‘warm start’ solutions to a Mixed Integer Programming solver for further improvement. We apply this hybrid framework to a section of the Danish rail network and benchmark our results against both direct application of a Mixed Integer Programming solver and modelling the problem as a Constraint Optimisation Problem. Whereas the current practice of using a general purpose Mixed Integer Programming solver is only able to solve instances over a two-week planning horizon, the hybrid framework generates good results for problem instances over an eight-week period.

In this paper we combine CBM on one (monitored) component, with periodic preventive maintenance (PM) and corrective maintenance (CM) on the other components of the same machine/system. We implement two thresholds on the degradation level to decide when to service the monitored component: when the degradation level of the monitored component surpasses a first ‘opportunistic’ threshold, the monitored component will be serviced together with other components, for instance with a (planned) PM intervention, or upon breakdown of another component, requiring CM. In case none of these opportunities have taken place, and the degradation level surpasses a second ‘intervention’ threshold, an additional maintenance intervention is planned for the monitored component in order to prevent a failure. Both thresholds are optimised to minimise the total expected maintenance costs of the monitored component, or to minimise the downtime of the machine due to maintenance on the monitored component. We perform an extensive numerical experiment to demonstrate the potential gains of this hybrid policy with two thresholds compared to using a traditional PM policy, and we identify its key drivers of performance.

Our model considers a conditional inspection policy: when component 1 is found to have failed, inspection of component 2 is triggered. This opportunistic inspection policy is a natural one to use given this stochastic dependence between the components. The long-run cost per unit time (cost-rate) of the conditional inspection policy is determined generally. A real system that cuts rebar mesh motivates the model development. The numerical examples reveal that when the ratio of the cost of corrective system replacement, that is on failure, to the cost of preventive system replacement is large there exists a finite optimum policy in most cases. Moreover, for the studied system wherein inspections of component 2 are expensive relative to those of component 1, having a reliable indicator of the defective state in component 2 is a good strategy to avoid costly failures of component 2, particularly when its time to failure is short.","('Delay-time', 'Inspection', 'Maintenance', 'multi-component system', 'Stochastic dependence')",condit inspect mainten system two interact compon elsevi b v in paper consid inspect mainten two compon system stochast depend a failur compon may induc defect state compon turn lead failur a failur compon defect compon detect inspect our model consid condit inspect polici compon found fail inspect compon trigger this opportunist inspect polici natur one use given stochast depend compon the long run cost per unit time cost rate condit inspect polici determin general a real system cut rebar mesh motiv model develop the numer exampl reveal ratio cost correct system replac failur cost prevent system replac larg exist finit optimum polici case moreov studi system wherein inspect compon expens relat compon reliabl indic defect state compon good strategi avoid cost failur compon particular time failur short delay time inspect mainten multi compon system stochast depend

Due to the limited maintenance resources, such as budget, time, and manpower, etc., it is oftentimes impossible to perform all the desirable maintenance actions in the break. In such circumstance, selective maintenance is able to identify a subset of feasible maintenance actions to be conducted, so as to guarantee the success of the next mission. In this paper, a new selective maintenance model for multi-state systems is developed to maximize the probability of a system successfully completing the next mission, while taking account of the stochasticity of the durations of breaks and maintenance actions. Due to the presence of these duration uncertainties, it necessitates (1) choosing a subset of maintenance actions from all the optional maintenance actions, and (2) planning a sequence of selected maintenance actions to be performed. The saddlepoint approximation is utilized to facilitate the computation of the involved multi-dimensional integration in evaluating the probability of a system successfully completing the next mission. The resulting constrained combinational optimization problem is resolved by a tailored ant colony optimization algorithm. A numerical example of a three-unit multi-state system, together with an illustrative example of a multi-state coal transportation system, is presented to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method.","('Ant colony optimization', 'Maintenance', 'Multi-state systems', 'Saddlepoint approximation', 'Selective maintenance')",on sequenc plan select mainten multi state system stochast mainten durat elsevi b v in mani industri militari environ system requir execut sequenc mission finit break two adjac mission due limit mainten resourc budget time manpow etc oftentim imposs perform desir mainten action break in circumst select mainten abl identifi subset feasibl mainten action conduct guarante success next mission in paper new select mainten model multi state system develop maxim probabl system success complet next mission take account stochast durat break mainten action due presenc durat uncertainti necessit choos subset mainten action option mainten action plan sequenc select mainten action perform the saddlepoint approxim util facilit comput involv multi dimension integr evalu probabl system success complet next mission the result constrain combin optim problem resolv tailor ant coloni optim algorithm a numer exampl three unit multi state system togeth illustr exampl multi state coal transport system present examin effect propos method ant coloni optim mainten multi state system saddlepoint approxim select mainten

In this paper, a new Markovian degradation process, the Transformed Beta process, is proposed, where the degradation growth depends on both the current age and degradation level. It is also shown that the Transformed Beta process shares the same stochastic properties of the Gamma process whose scale parameter is Gamma-distributed, and that the likelihood functions relative to a given set of degradation data under these two models coincide. Due to this circumstance, it is not possible to choose between these two models on the basis of degradation data alone, even though they rely on quite different assumptions. On the other hand, although these models are stochastically equivalent, there are situations in which selecting the wrong model can produce real practical consequences. In fact, it is shown that, if the considered degrading unit is subjected to a so-called “virtual age imperfect maintenance” where the current degradation level is assumed to be lowered through an age reduction maintenance model, then these two alternative models provide different condition-based distributions of the degradation growth. Hence, in this latter case, a model misidentification can produce wrong predictions of the degradation growth and wrong estimates of the residual reliability. The discussed issue is illustrated via a numerical application based on a real set of degradation data.","('Gamma process', 'Imperfect maintenance', 'Model misidentification', 'Stochastic processes', 'Transformed Beta process')",a new state depend degrad process relat model misidentif problem elsevi b v the gamma process random scale paramet often use describ independ increment degrad phenomena presenc random effect in paper new markovian degrad process transform beta process propos degrad growth depend current age degrad level it also shown transform beta process share stochast properti gamma process whose scale paramet gamma distribut likelihood function relat given set degrad data two model coincid due circumst possibl choos two model basi degrad data alon even though reli quit differ assumpt on hand although model stochast equival situat select wrong model produc real practic consequ in fact shown that consid degrad unit subject so call virtual age imperfect mainten current degrad level assum lower age reduct mainten model two altern model provid differ condit base distribut degrad growth henc latter case model misidentif produc wrong predict degrad growth wrong estim residu reliabl the discuss issu illustr via numer applic base real set degrad data gamma process imperfect mainten model misidentif stochast process transform beta process

This paper is concerned with the timing of offshore turbine maintenance for a turbine that is no longer functioning. Service vehicle access is limited by the weather, with wave height being the important factor in deciding whether access can be achieved safely. If the vehicle is mobilized, but the wave height then exceeds the safe limit, the journey is wasted. Conversely, if the vehicle is not mobilized, and the wave height then does not exceed the limit, the opportunity to repair the turbine has been wasted. Previous work has based the decision as to whether to mobilize a service vessel on point forecasts for wave height. In this paper, we incorporate probabilistic forecasting to enable rational decision making by the maintenance engineers, and to improve situational awareness regarding risk. We show that, in terms of minimizing expected cost, the decision as to whether to send the service vessel depends on the value of the probability of wave height falling below the safe limit. We produce forecasts of this probability using time series methods specifically designed for generating wave height density forecasts, including ARMA-GARCH models. We evaluate the methods in terms of statistical probability forecast accuracy, as well as monetary impact, and we examine the sensitivity of the results to different values of the costs.","('Offshore wind operations and maintenance', 'OR in energy', 'probabilistic forecasting', 'Wave height')",probabilist forecast wave height offshor wind turbin mainten elsevi b v wind power continu fastest grow sourc renew energi this paper concern time offshor turbin mainten turbin longer function servic vehicl access limit weather wave height import factor decid whether access achiev safe if vehicl mobil wave height exceed safe limit journey wast convers vehicl mobil wave height exceed limit opportun repair turbin wast previous work base decis whether mobil servic vessel point forecast wave height in paper incorpor probabilist forecast enabl ration decis make mainten engin improv situat awar regard risk we show that term minim expect cost decis whether send servic vessel depend valu probabl wave height fall safe limit we produc forecast probabl use time seri method specif design generat wave height densiti forecast includ arma garch model we evalu method term statist probabl forecast accuraci well monetari impact examin sensit result differ valu cost offshor wind oper mainten or energi probabilist forecast wave height

In the first and second stage, we therefore make a trade-off between the training costs and the resulting cheaper workforce schedule. As we assume that workers are unavailable to work during their training, the resulting schedules are only applicable in practice if the required training can be performed without endangering the current maintenance operations. In the third stage, we therefore want to find an optimal and feasible training schedule in order to obtain the desired skill mix with minimal costs.

The efficacy of inspection is modelled using the delay time concept.

Furthermore, replacements are considered to be heterogeneous and of variable quality. This is a natural policy for heterogeneous systems.

This study proposes a new device, called customization, which can convert a given ESMDP into another equivalent ESMDP whose formulation possibly simplifies mathematical analysis. The customization technique uses the fictitious jump idea to establish the equivalence under deterministic stationary policies just like the uniformization technique. However, it allows the transition rates of the new ESMDP to be different. Moreover, it can be applied even when the transition rates of the initial ESMDP are unbounded. This flexibility can be very useful in analyzing the problems where the uniformization is not applicable or not so helpful. We analyze a complex optimal replacement problem and an infinite server queueing problem with unbounded transition rates to demonstrate the applicability and advantages of customization.","('Customization', 'Infinite server queue', 'Markov decision processes', 'Markov processes', 'Optimal maintenance')",custom exponenti semi markov decis process discount cost criterion elsevi b v the uniform techniqu wide use method establish exist optim polici certain monoton properti this techniqu convert semi markov decis process exponenti sojourn time esmdp equival discret time markov decis process defin fictiti jump this studi propos new devic call custom convert given esmdp anoth equival esmdp whose formul possibl simplifi mathemat analysi the custom techniqu use fictiti jump idea establish equival determinist stationari polici like uniform techniqu howev allow transit rate new esmdp differ moreov appli even transit rate initi esmdp unbound this flexibl use analyz problem uniform applic help we analyz complex optim replac problem infinit server queue problem unbound transit rate demonstr applic advantag custom custom infinit server queue markov decis process markov process optim mainten

Then, the cost-minimization is changed into a profit-maximization problem of generation companies (GENCOs) and the GMS is developed as a bi-level optimization. Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are applied to transform the bi-level into a single-level mixed-integer linear problem and subsequently, Nash equilibrium is obtained as the final solution for the GMS under a deregulated market (profit-maximization GMS). Moreover, to incorporate reliability and economic regulatory constraints, two rescheduling signals (incentive and penalty) are considered as coordination processes among GENCOs and independent system operators. These signals are based on energy-not-supplied and operation cost, and ensure that the result of profit-maximization GMS is in the given reliability and social cost limits, respectively. These limits are obtained from the cost-minimization GMS. Lastly, the model is evaluated on a test system.

Connection elements (CE) characterized by diverse connection ranges, time-to-failure and time-to-repair distributions are allocated to different nodes to provide the system connectivity, i.e., a connection between the source and sink nodes of the LCCS. Examples of LCCSs abound in practical applications such as flow transmission systems and radio communication systems. Considerable research efforts have been expended in modeling and optimizing LCCSs. However, most of the existing works have assumed that CEs either are non-repairable or undergo a restrictive minimal repair policy with constant repair time. This paper makes new technical contributions by modeling and optimizing LCCSs with CEs under corrective maintenance with random repair time and different repair policies (minimal, perfect, and imperfect). The characteristics of CEs can depend on their location because the distance between adjacent nodes and conditions of CE operation and maintenance at different nodes can be different, which further complicates the problem. We first propose a discrete numerical algorithm to evaluate the instantaneous availability of each CE. A universal generating function based method is then implemented for assessing instantaneous and expected system connectivity for a specific CE allocation. As the CE allocation can have significant impacts on the system connectivity, we further define and solve the optimal CE allocation problem, whose objective is to find the CE allocation among LCCS nodes maximizing the expected system connectivity over a given mission time. Effects of different parameters including repair efficiency, mission time and repair time are investigated. As illustrated through examples, optimization results can facilitate optimal decisions on robust design and effective operation and maintenance managements of LCCSs.","('Applied probability', 'Connectivity optimization', 'Linear consecutively connected system', 'Operation management', 'Random repair time')",connect model optim linear consecut connect system repair connect element elsevi b v linear consecut connect system lccss system contain linear sequenc order node connect element ce character divers connect rang time to failur time to repair distribut alloc differ node provid system connect i e connect sourc sink node lccs exampl lccss abound practic applic flow transmiss system radio communic system consider research effort expend model optim lccss howev exist work assum ces either non repair undergo restrict minim repair polici constant repair time this paper make new technic contribut model optim lccss ces correct mainten random repair time differ repair polici minim perfect imperfect the characterist ces depend locat distanc adjac node condit ce oper mainten differ node differ complic problem we first propos discret numer algorithm evalu instantan avail ce a univers generat function base method implement assess instantan expect system connect specif ce alloc as ce alloc signific impact system connect defin solv optim ce alloc problem whose object find ce alloc among lccs node maxim expect system connect given mission time effect differ paramet includ repair effici mission time repair time investig as illustr exampl optim result facilit optim decis robust design effect oper mainten manag lccss appli probabl connect optim linear consecut connect system oper manag random repair time

While maintenance plans commonly span multiple days, the methods used to compute tail assignments for the given plans can be overly complex and provide little recourse in the event of schedule perturbations. The presented approach addresses operational uncertainty by using solutions from the one-day routes aircraft maintenance routing approach as input. The daily tail assignment problem is solved with an objective to satisfy maintenance requirements explicitly for the current day and implicitly for the subsequent two days. A computational study will be performed to assess the performance of exact and heuristic solution algorithms that modify the input lines-of-flight to reduce maintenance misalignments.

The mathematical programming formulation proposed is compact (i.e., involves a number of 0−1 decision variables and constraints polynomial in the problem size parameters) and is shown to be of significantly reduced dimension as compared with previously known compact models. Computational experiments on series of realistic problem instances (obtained by random sampling from real-world data set) are reported. It is shown that with the proposed model, current state-of-the art MIP solvers can efficiently solve to exact optimality large instances representing 30-day flight schedules with typically up to 40 airplanes and 1500 flight legs connecting as many as 21 airports.

However, in practice, the operating cost increases while the system ages and degrades even if a system is in a functioning state. This paper proposes a maintenance policy for a degrading system with age- and state-dependent operating cost, which increases with system age and degradation levels. Under such a setting, a replacement model is first developed to investigate the optimal preventive replacement policy. The replacement model is then extended to a repair-replacement model, in which imperfect repair is assumed to restore the system to the operating condition. Particularly, the repair model with controllable and uncontrollable repair levels is considered separately. The paper proves that the optimal maintenance policy is actually a monotone control limit policy, where the optimal control limits decrease monotonically with system age. Finally, a numerical example along with sensitivity analysis is presented to illustrate the optimal maintenance policy. The proposed model implies a more conservative maintenance policy, compared with the traditional model without the age- and state-dependent operating cost.","('(T) Maintenance', 'Age- and state-dependent operating cost', 'Condition-based maintenance', 'Control limit policy', 'Side effect of degradation')",a condit base mainten polici degrad system age state depend oper cost elsevi b v most mainten polici exist public assum cost incur long system undertak mission littl consider devot oper cost system oper howev practic oper cost increas system age degrad even system function state this paper propos mainten polici degrad system age state depend oper cost increas system age degrad level under set replac model first develop investig optim prevent replac polici the replac model extend repair replac model imperfect repair assum restor system oper condit particular repair model control uncontrol repair level consid separ the paper prove optim mainten polici actual monoton control limit polici optim control limit decreas monoton system age final numer exampl along sensit analysi present illustr optim mainten polici the propos model impli conserv mainten polici compar tradit model without age state depend oper cost t mainten age state depend oper cost condit base mainten control limit polici side effect degrad

Such statements correspond to weight constraints, and thus impact on which project portfolios are potentially optimal or non-dominated in view of the resulting set of feasible attribute weights. In this paper, we extend earlier preference elicitation approaches by allowing the decision maker to make direct statements about the selection and rejection of individual projects. We convert such project preference statements to weight information by determining the weights for which (i) the selected project is included in all potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolios, or (ii) the rejected project is not included in any potentially optimal or non-dominated portfolio. We prove that the two complementary selection rules will exclude exactly the same set of weights. However, analyses that apply the dominance structure often lead to multiple, mutually exclusive feasible weight sets, and therefore the approach based on potential optimality is more relevant for practical decision analysis. We also propose ex ante value of information measures to guide the elicitation of project preference statements, and illustrate our results by analyzing a real case on the selection of infrastructure maintenance projects.","('Multi-attribute value theory', 'Multiple criteria analysis', 'Preference modeling', 'Project portfolio selection')",model project prefer multiattribut portfolio decis analysi the authorswhen choos portfolio project multi attribut weight model necessari elicit trade off statement import attribut relat other such statement correspond weight constraint thus impact project portfolio potenti optim non domin view result set feasibl attribut weight in paper extend earlier prefer elicit approach allow decis maker make direct statement select reject individu project we convert project prefer statement weight inform determin weight i select project includ potenti optim non domin portfolio ii reject project includ potenti optim non domin portfolio we prove two complementari select rule exclud exact set weight howev analys appli domin structur often lead multipl mutual exclus feasibl weight set therefor approach base potenti optim relev practic decis analysi we also propos ex ant valu inform measur guid elicit project prefer statement illustr result analyz real case select infrastructur mainten project multi attribut valu theori multipl criteria analysi prefer model project portfolio select

Under this policy, maintenance activities as well as the ordering and holding activities for spare parts at each decision point are determined according to the maintenance requirement determined by the state of deterioration of the entire system and the state of the spare parts inventory. On the basis of the derivation of all possible maintenance and spare-parts-related activities at each decision point and their corresponding probabilities, an expected long-run cost rate model is formulated for a general, identical multiunit system to determine its joint optimal strategy. This is accomplished by using semiregenerative process theory that takes into account the cost of maintenance and that of the management of the spare parts inventory. In this model, all possible maintenance requirements and their probabilities are derived using the deterioration state-space partitioning method combined with the derivation of the stationary law of the system state affected by opportunistic maintenance. Further, maintenance activities, the ordering and holding actions for spare parts, and their corresponding probabilities are all determined on this basis. Finally, a case study is carried out to test the proposed optimization method. This involves a wind power farm consisting of a large number of identical main bearings in the turbines. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze the effects of the model.","('Deterioration state-space partitioning method', 'Joint optimization', 'Maintenance', 'Multiunit system', 'Spare parts provision')",joint optim condit base opportunist mainten spare part provis polici multiunit system elsevi b v this studi investig joint optim strategi period condit base opportunist prevent mainten cbom safeti polici provis spare part multiunit system known number ident unit under polici mainten activ well order hold activ spare part decis point determin accord mainten requir determin state deterior entir system state spare part inventori on basi deriv possibl mainten spare part relat activ decis point correspond probabl expect long run cost rate model formul general ident multiunit system determin joint optim strategi this accomplish use semiregen process theori take account cost mainten manag spare part inventori in model possibl mainten requir probabl deriv use deterior state space partit method combin deriv stationari law system state affect opportunist mainten further mainten activ order hold action spare part correspond probabl determin basi final case studi carri test propos optim method this involv wind power farm consist larg number ident main bear turbin furthermor sensit analysi conduct analyz effect model deterior state space partit method joint optim mainten multiunit system spare part provis

In practice, the energy consumption of a facility, which will be affected by the operation condition, is closely connected with the associated maintenance policy. Specifically, for an energy-consuming service system, though a frequent maintenance activity can keep the facility in a good condition with low energy consumption, it makes the delay time longer and leads to a poor customer experience. In this paper, we study a single-server queueing system with different energy consumption levels in the associated running states to address the conflict between energy consumption and customer delay. Two types of maintenance activities are implemented for the server, i.e., the planned maintenance and the reactive maintenance. The planned maintenance is adopted based on a frequency parameter at the beginning of an idle period, and the reactive maintenance is initialized by the Shewhart's individual control chart (condition-based maintenance). To capture the energy-delay tradeoff, our objective is to develop an optimal maintenance policy that minimizes the long-run expected total cost of the system under a customer waiting time constraint. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze the problem, in which useful managerial insights are obtained for the optimal maintenance policy. The results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed maintenance model, its advantage over the model without control chart, and its applicability in general situations.","('Control chart', 'Energy-delay tradeoff', 'Maintenance', 'OR in energy', 'Queueing system')",a control chart base queue approach servic facil mainten energi delay tradeoff elsevi b v mainten plan energi consumpt control critic issu facil oper manag in practic energi consumpt facil affect oper condit close connect associ mainten polici specif energi consum servic system though frequent mainten activ keep facil good condit low energi consumpt make delay time longer lead poor custom experi in paper studi singl server queue system differ energi consumpt level associ run state address conflict energi consumpt custom delay two type mainten activ implement server i e plan mainten reactiv mainten the plan mainten adopt base frequenc paramet begin idl period reactiv mainten initi shewhart s individu control chart condit base mainten to captur energi delay tradeoff object develop optim mainten polici minim long run expect total cost system custom wait time constraint numer experi conduct analyz problem use manageri insight obtain optim mainten polici the result demonstr robust propos mainten model advantag model without control chart applic general situat control chart energi delay tradeoff mainten or energi queue system

The application of CBM in practice, however, is lagging behind. This is, at least in part, explained by the complexity of real-life systems as opposed to the stylized ones studied most often. To overcome this issue, research is focusing more and more on complex systems, with multiple components subject to various dependencies. Existing classifications of these dependencies in the literature are no longer sufficient. Therefore, we provide an extended classification scheme. Besides the types of dependencies identified in the past (economic, structural, and stochastic), we add resource dependence, where multiple components are connected through, e.g., shared spares, tools, or maintenance workers. Furthermore, we extend the existing notion of structural dependence by distinguishing between structural dependence from a technical point of view and structural dependence from a performance point of view (e.g., through a series or parallel setting). We review the advances made with respect to CBM. Our main focus is on the implications of dependencies on the structure of the optimal CBM policy. We link our review to practice by providing real-life examples, thereby stressing current gaps in the literature.","('Condition-based maintenance', 'Dependencies', 'Maintenance', 'Multi-component', 'Review')",condit base mainten polici system multipl depend compon a review elsevi b v condit base mainten cbm receiv increas attent literatur past year the applic cbm practic howev lag behind this is least part explain complex real life system oppos styliz one studi often to overcom issu research focus complex system multipl compon subject various depend exist classif depend literatur longer suffici therefor provid extend classif scheme besid type depend identifi past econom structur stochast add resourc depend multipl compon connect through e g share spare tool mainten worker furthermor extend exist notion structur depend distinguish structur depend technic point view structur depend perform point view e g seri parallel set we review advanc made respect cbm our main focus implic depend structur optim cbm polici we link review practic provid real life exampl therebi stress current gap literatur condit base mainten depend mainten multi compon review

This study investigates the effects that the classification of a customer and the time-usage ratio of the repairable deteriorating product have on breakdowns of such a product to effectively manage the total costs within the extended warranty period. Periodic and non-periodic preventive maintenance programs are both considered to meet different customer requirements to ensure that product reliability would not be gradually unacceptable. By adopting the proposed extended warranty approach, customers with high utilization rates could have satisfactory reliability on their products by performing more frequent PM activities, while those with low and average utilization rates could reduce the cost of PM within the extended warranty period, and also enjoy acceptable product availability.

The model takes into account multiple vessels, multiple periods (days), multiple Operation & Maintenance (O&M) bases, and multiple wind farms. We develop an algorithm based on the Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition method, where a mixed integer linear program is solved for each subset of turbines to generate all feasible routes and maintenance schedules for the vessels for each period. The routes have to consider several constraints such as weather conditions, the availability of vessels, and the number of technicians available at the O&M base. An integer linear program model is then proposed to find the optimal route configuration along with the maintenance schedules that minimise maintenance costs, including travel, technician and penalty costs.

Demand for each part is a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP). Each fleet has a target for the maximum expected number of assets down for lack of a spare part. The inventory manager can meet this target by stocking repairables and by expediting the repair of parts. Expedited repairs have a shorter lead time. There are multiple repair shops (or departments) that handle the repair of parts and the load imposed on repair shops by expedited repairs is constrained. A dual-index policy makes stocking and expediting decisions that depend on demand fluctuations for each spare part type. We formulate the above problem as a non-linear non-convex integer programing problem and provide an algorithm based on column generation to compute feasible near optimal solutions and tight lower bounds.

This problem arises from real environments in which processing a job later than at a specific time may require an extra processing time. This time-dependent variation is known in the literature as step deterioration and has several practical applications (production planning, computer programming, medicine treatment, equipment maintenance, etc.). In the problem tackled in this work we aim to minimize the total completion time on identical parallel machines where each job has a deteriorating date and observes a step function for the processing time. For solving it, we propose two novel mathematical models based on the Set Partitioning Problem (SPP) that improve the unique model proposed in the literature. The computational performance of these models implemented in a general purpose solver allows to compete with the best algorithms proposed in the literature. Finally, we provide some insights for managing similar SPP formulations when large-sized instances have to be addressed.","('Machine scheduling', 'Mathematical programming', 'Parallel machine scheduling with step deteriorating jobs', 'Set-partitioning formulations', 'Step deterioration')",model parallel machin schedul problem step deterior job elsevi b v all right reserv this paper address parallel machin schedul problem step deterior job this problem aris real environ process job later specif time may requir extra process time this time depend variat known literatur step deterior sever practic applic product plan comput program medicin treatment equip mainten etc in problem tackl work aim minim total complet time ident parallel machin job deterior date observ step function process time for solv it propos two novel mathemat model base set partit problem spp improv uniqu model propos literatur the comput perform model implement general purpos solver allow compet best algorithm propos literatur final provid insight manag similar spp formul larg size instanc address machin schedul mathemat program parallel machin schedul step deterior job set partit formul step deterior

Two non-cooperative game-theoretic models and a cooperative model are developed to describe the relationships between the two decision makers. In the non-cooperative simultaneous move game, the lessee and the lessor act simultaneously and independently to make their decisions. In the leader-follower non-cooperative game, the lessor is the leader who specifies the maintenance policy first, and the lessee, as the follower, decides on the lease period and usage rate accordingly. For these two games, the Nash and Stackelberg equilibria are obtained respectively. For the cooperative game, we derive the solution targeting on total profit maximization and show that this solution can be implemented as an equilibrium using a nonlinear transfer-payment contract. Besides, we compare the Nash equilibrium, Stackelberg equilibrium, and the total maximum solution to each other, and our results show that the lessee and lessor can gain more profit from the cooperative contract than from the non-cooperative alternatives.

All rights reserved.This paper presents a novel approach to the problem of infrastructure development by integrating technical, economic and operational aspects, as well as the interactions between the entities who jointly carry out the project. The problem is defined within the context of a Public Private Partnership (PPP), where a public entity delegates the design, construction and maintenance of an infrastructure system to a private entity. Despite the benefits of this procurement method, the relationship between the two entities is inherently conflictive. Three main factors give rise to such conflict: the goals of the public and private party do not coincide, there is information asymmetry between them and their interaction unfolds in environments under uncertainty. The theory of contracts refers to this problem as a principal-agent problem; however, due to the complexity of the problem, it is necessary to recreate a dynamic interaction between the principal (i.e., the public entity) and the agent (i.e., the private entity) while including the monitoring of the infrastructure performance as an essential part of the interaction. The complex relationship between the sequential actions of players and the time-dependent behavior of a physical system is explored using a hybrid agent-based simulation model. The model is illustrated with several examples that show the versatility of the approach and its ability to accommodate the different decision strategies of the players (i.e., principal, agent) and the model of a physical infrastructure system.","('Agent-based model', 'Infrastructure systems', 'Life-cycle engineering', 'Public private partnership', 'System dynamics')",a dynam princip agent framework model perform infrastructur elsevi b v all right reserv this paper present novel approach problem infrastructur develop integr technic econom oper aspect well interact entiti joint carri project the problem defin within context public privat partnership ppp public entiti deleg design construct mainten infrastructur system privat entiti despit benefit procur method relationship two entiti inher conflict three main factor give rise conflict goal public privat parti coincid inform asymmetri interact unfold environ uncertainti the theori contract refer problem princip agent problem howev due complex problem necessari recreat dynam interact princip i e public entiti agent i e privat entiti includ monitor infrastructur perform essenti part interact the complex relationship sequenti action player time depend behavior physic system explor use hybrid agent base simul model the model illustr sever exampl show versatil approach abil accommod differ decis strategi player i e princip agent model physic infrastructur system agent base model infrastructur system life cycl engin public privat partnership system dynam

The algorithm, referred as Modified DE with Locality induced Genetic Operators (MDE-LiGO) incorporates changes in the three basic stages of a standard DE framework. The mutation phase has been entrusted to a locality-induced operation that retains traits of Euclidean distance-based closest individuals around a potential solution. Diversity maintenance is further enhanced by inclusion of a local-best crossover operation that empowers the algorithm with an explorative ability without directional bias. An exhaustive dynamic detection technique has been introduced to effectively sense the changes in the landscape. An even distribution of solutions over different regions of the landscape calls for a solution retention technique that adapts this algorithm to dynamism by using the previously stored information in diverse search domains. MDE-LiGO has been compared with seven state-of-the-art evolutionary dynamic optimizers on a set of benchmarks known as the Generalized Dynamic Benchmark Generator (GDBG) used in competition on evolutionary computation in dynamic and uncertain environments held under the 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC).

The CBM activities can significantly increase the uptime of a machine. However, they should be conducted in a coordinated way with the production plan to reduce the interruptions. On the other hand, the production lot size should also be optimized by taking the CBM activities into account. Relatively fewer works have been done to investigate the impact of the CBM policy on production lot-sizing and to propose joint optimization models of both the economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) and CBM policy. In this paper, we evaluate the average long-run cost rate of a degrading manufacturing system using renewal theory. The optimal EMQ and CBM policy can be obtained by minimizing the average long-run cost rate that includes setup cost, inventory holding cost, lost sales cost, predictive maintenance cost and corrective maintenance cost. Unlike previous works on this topic, we allow the use of continuous time and continuous state degradation processes, which broadens the application area of this model.

In this paper, we assume that an item is randomly selected from a mixed population composed of two stochastically ordered subpopulations and that the subpopulation, from which the item is chosen, is unknown.

For illustration of the proposed model, we provide and discuss relevant numerical examples.","('Mixed population', 'Operational history', 'Repairable item', 'Stochastically ordered subpopulations', 'Warranty policy')",on inform base warranti polici repair product heterogen popul elsevi b v all right reserv prevent mainten warranti period crucial effect warranti servic cost numer paper optim mainten strategi warrant item focus case item homogen popul howev real life popul heterogen in paper assum item random select mix popul compos two stochast order subpopul subpopul item chosen unknown as oper histori item contain inform chosen subpopul util inform develop justifi new inform base warranti polici for illustr propos model provid discuss relev numer exampl mix popul oper histori repair item stochast order subpopul warranti polici

All rights reserved.Complex multi-state warm standby systems subject to different types of failures and preventive maintenance are modelled by considering discrete marked Markovian arrival processes. The system is composed of K units, one online and the rest in warm standby and by an indefinite number of repairpersons, R. The online unit passes through several performance states, which are partitioned into two types: minor and major. This unit can fail due to wear or to external shock. In both cases of failures, the failure can be repairable or non-repairable. Warm standby units can only undergo repairable failures due to wear. Derived systems are modelled from the basic one according to the type of the failure; repairable or non-repairable, and preventive maintenance. When a unit undergoes a repairable failure, it goes to the repair facility for corrective repair, and if it is non-repairable, it is replaced by a new, identical one. Preventive maintenance is carried out in response to random inspections. When an inspection takes place, the online unit is observed and if the performance state is major, the unit is sent to the repair facility for preventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance and corrective repair times follow different distributions according to the type of failure. The systems are modelled in transient regime, relevant performance measures are obtained, and rewards and costs are calculated. All results are expressed in algorithmic form and implemented computationally with Matlab. A numerical example shows the versatility of the model presented.","('Marked Markovian Arrival Process (MMAP)', 'Markov modelling', 'Multi-state systems', 'Phase type distribution', 'Reliability')",complex multi state system model mark markovian arriv process elsevi b v all right reserv complex multi state warm standbi system subject differ type failur prevent mainten model consid discret mark markovian arriv process the system compos k unit one onlin rest warm standbi indefinit number repairperson r the onlin unit pass sever perform state partit two type minor major this unit fail due wear extern shock in case failur failur repair non repair warm standbi unit undergo repair failur due wear deriv system model basic one accord type failur repair non repair prevent mainten when unit undergo repair failur goe repair facil correct repair non repair replac new ident one prevent mainten carri respons random inspect when inspect take place onlin unit observ perform state major unit sent repair facil prevent mainten prevent mainten correct repair time follow differ distribut accord type failur the system model transient regim relev perform measur obtain reward cost calcul all result express algorithm form implement comput matlab a numer exampl show versatil model present mark markovian arriv process mmap markov model multi state system phase type distribut reliabl

The problem is to determine when to perform the tamping on which section for given railway tracks over a planning horizon. The objective is to minimize the Net Present Costs (NPC) considering the following technical and economic factors: 1) track quality (the standard deviation of the longitudinal level) degradation over time; 2) track quality thresholds based on train speed limits; 3) the impact of previous tamping operations on the track quality recovery; 4) track geometrical alignment; 5) tamping machine operation factors and finally 6) the discount rate.

Computational experiments are carried out to compare our model to the existing models in the literature.

All rights reserved.Planned infrastructure works reduce the available capacity of a railway system and make it more vulnerable to conflicts and delay propagation. The starting point of this paper is a published timetable that needs to be adapted due to the temporary unavailability of some resources. Since the timetable is in operation, changed arrival or departure times and cancelations have an impact on the passengers who need to adapt their travel behavior. In the light of passenger service, a trade-off is made between these inconveniences and the delays that occur in practice due to the reduced capacity. Taking the robustness of the adapted railway timetable into account is a new approach to rescheduling in case of a planned infrastructure unavailability. In this paper, an algorithm that adjusts the train routing and the train schedule to the planned maintenance interventions and keeps the level of passenger service as high as possible is presented. To avoid large inconveniences, the developed algorithm tries to minimize the number of cancelations. Computational results show that by allowing small modifications to the routing and the timetable, the robustness of the resulting solution can improve by more than 10 percent and only few trains need to be canceled.","('Maintenance', 'Mixed integer linear programing', 'Railway timetabling', 'Robustness', 'Transportation')",an iter approach reduc impact infrastructur mainten perform railway system elsevi b v all right reserv plan infrastructur work reduc avail capac railway system make vulner conflict delay propag the start point paper publish timet need adapt due temporari unavail resourc sinc timet oper chang arriv departur time cancel impact passeng need adapt travel behavior in light passeng servic trade off made inconveni delay occur practic due reduc capac take robust adapt railway timet account new approach reschedul case plan infrastructur unavail in paper algorithm adjust train rout train schedul plan mainten intervent keep level passeng servic high possibl present to avoid larg inconveni develop algorithm tri minim number cancel comput result show allow small modif rout timet robust result solut improv percent train need cancel mainten mix integ linear program railway timet robust transport

Several performance criteria and different maintenance systems have been proposed in the literature, leading basically to assignment problems as the underlying model.

This can be done for very general processing times and maintenance durations. The solutions to the assignment problems are determined first. They define the order in which the jobs are to be processed on the various machines and only then the vital informations about the schedule are retrieved, like completion and maintenance times. It will be shown that these matrices are easily obtained, and this approach does not necessitate any complex calculations.","('Assignment problem', 'Parallel machines', 'Position-dependent processing', 'Time-dependent maintenance')",parallel machin schedul mainten prais assign problem elsevi b v all right reserv we consid general model schedul job unrel parallel machin mainten intervent the process time deterior posit product sequenc goal mainten help restor good process condit the mainten durat depend time elaps sinc last mainten intervent sever perform criteria differ mainten system propos literatur lead basic assign problem under model we shall invers approach start first set matrix assign problem catch inform product mainten system this done general process time mainten durat the solut assign problem determin first they defin order job process various machin vital inform schedul retriev like complet mainten time it shown matric easili obtain approach necessit complex calcul assign problem parallel machin posit depend process time depend mainten

All rights reserved.Systems that require maintenance typically consist of multiple components. In case of economic dependencies, maintaining several of these components simultaneously can be more cost efficient than performing maintenance on each component separately, while in case of redundancy, postponing maintenance on some failed components is possible without reducing the availability of the system. Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is known as a cost-minimizing strategy in which the maintenance actions are based on the actual condition of the different components. No research has been performed yet on clustering CBM tasks for systems with both economic dependencies and redundancy. We develop a dynamic programming model to find the optimal maintenance strategy for such systems, and show numerically that it can indeed considerably outperform previously considered policies (failure-based, age-based, block replacement, and more restricted (opportunistic) CBM policies). Moreover, our numerical investigation provides insights into the optimal policy structure.","('Dynamic programming', 'Economic dependencies', 'Maintenance', 'Redundancy', 'Reliability')",cluster condit base mainten system redund econom depend elsevi b v all right reserv system requir mainten typic consist multipl compon in case econom depend maintain sever compon simultan cost effici perform mainten compon separ case redund postpon mainten fail compon possibl without reduc avail system condit base mainten cbm known cost minim strategi mainten action base actual condit differ compon no research perform yet cluster cbm task system econom depend redund we develop dynam program model find optim mainten strategi system show numer inde consider outperform previous consid polici failur base age base block replac restrict opportunist cbm polici moreov numer investig provid insight optim polici structur dynam program econom depend mainten redund reliabl

One finding is that significant polyhedral attributes of its solution space are derived. Among them, quasi-integrality that allows for applying an integral simplex algorithm is proven. Moreover, we prove strong NP-hardness and propose an exact solution procedure that is polynomial if the number of considered maintenance activities or the number of periods is constant. Since at least one restriction applies to most real-world applications, the algorithm provides practical decision support. Furthermore, the complexity status of various polynomial special cases of the WUPMP is resolved.","('Complexity results', 'Deterministic maintenance problem', 'Polyhedral properties', 'Scheduling maintenance activities')",the weight uncapacit plan mainten problem complex polyhedr properti elsevi b v and associ european oper research societi euro intern feder oper research societi ifor all right reserv this paper introduc weight uncapacit plan mainten problem wupmp base guarante maximum servic interv wupmp pursu find mainten schedul minim result total fix variabl cost one find signific polyhedr attribut solut space deriv among them quasi integr allow appli integr simplex algorithm proven moreov prove strong np hard propos exact solut procedur polynomi number consid mainten activ number period constant sinc least one restrict appli real world applic algorithm provid practic decis support furthermor complex status various polynomi special case wupmp resolv complex result determinist mainten problem polyhedr properti schedul mainten activ

In this paper, we present a model that considers a single-unit system subject to both CM and additional manual inspections. There are two preset control limits: an inspection threshold and a preventive replacement (PR) threshold. When a CM measurement is equal to or greater than the inspection threshold but is less than the PR threshold, a manual inspection activity is initiated. When a CM measurement is greater than the PR threshold, a PR activity should be carried out. The system's degradation process evolves according to a two-stage failure process: the normal working stage, which is from new to the initial point that a defect occurs, with the CM measurement coming from a stochastic process; and the delay-time stage, which is from the initial point that a defect occurs until the point of failure, with the CM measurement coming from an increasing stochastic process. We assume that a manual inspection is perfect in that it can always identify which of these two stages the system is in. In our study, the decision variables are the CM interval and the inspection threshold, and we aim to minimize the expected cost per unit time. We provide a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability and solution procedure of the model.","('Condition monitoring', 'Delay-time', 'Inspection', 'Maintenance', 'Two-stage failure process')",prevent replac system condit monitor addit manual inspect elsevi b v associ european oper research societi euro with intern feder oper research societi ifor all right reserv condit monitor cm manual inspect increas use industri identifi system s state necessari prevent mainten pm decis made in paper present model consid singl unit system subject cm addit manual inspect there two preset control limit inspect threshold prevent replac pr threshold when cm measur equal greater inspect threshold less pr threshold manual inspect activ initi when cm measur greater pr threshold pr activ carri out the system s degrad process evolv accord two stage failur process normal work stage new initi point defect occur cm measur come stochast process delay time stage initi point defect occur point failur cm measur come increas stochast process we assum manual inspect perfect alway identifi two stage system in in studi decis variabl cm interv inspect threshold aim minim expect cost per unit time we provid numer exampl demonstr applic solut procedur model condit monitor delay time inspect mainten two stage failur process

The item that is replaced is called the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU), and the so-called LRU definition problem is the problem of deciding on which item to replace upon each type of failure: when a replacement action is required in the field, service engineers can either replace the failed item itself or replace a parent assembly that holds the failed item. One option may be fast but expensive, while the other may take longer but against lower cost. We consider a maintenance organization that services a fleet of assets, so that unavailability due to maintenance downtime may be compensated by acquiring additional standby assets. The objective of the LRU-definition problem is to minimize the total cost of item replacement and the investment in additional assets, given a constraint on the availability of the fleet of assets. We link this problem to the literature. We also present two cases to show how the problem is treated in practice. We next model the problem as a mixed integer linear programming formulation, and we use a numerical experiment to illustrate the model, and the potential cost reductions that using such a model may lead to.","('Integer programming', 'Line replaceable unit definition', 'Maintenance', 'Replacement')",defin line replac unit elsevi b v associ european oper research societi euro withinth intern feder oper research societi ifor all rightsreserv defect capit asset may quick restor oper condit replac item fail the item replac call line replac unit lru so call lru definit problem problem decid item replac upon type failur replac action requir field servic engin either replac fail item replac parent assembl hold fail item one option may fast expens may take longer lower cost we consid mainten organ servic fleet asset unavail due mainten downtim may compens acquir addit standbi asset the object lru definit problem minim total cost item replac invest addit asset given constraint avail fleet asset we link problem literatur we also present two case show problem treat practic we next model problem mix integ linear program formul use numer experi illustr model potenti cost reduct use model may lead to integ program line replac unit definit mainten replac

To deal with this stochasticity, a model enhancement algorithm is proposed that iteratively adjusts a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to a stochastic environment based on simulation results. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with a computational experiment based on real life data of a large aircraft maintenance company located at Brussels Airport in Belgium. The obtained results are compared to deterministic optimization and straightforward optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our model can ensure a certain desired service level with an acceptable increase in labor costs when stochasticity is introduced in the aircraft arrival times.","('Aircraft maintenance', 'Model enhancement', 'Stochastic optimization')",a model enhanc heurist build robust aircraft mainten personnel roster stochast constraint elsevi b v associ european oper research societi euro intern feder oper research societi ifor all right reserv this paper present heurist approach optim staf schedul aircraft mainten compani the goal build robust aircraft mainten personnel roster achiev certain servic level minim total labor cost robust personnel roster roster handl delay associ stochast flight arriv time to deal stochast model enhanc algorithm propos iter adjust mix integ linear program milp model stochast environ base simul result we illustr perform algorithm comput experi base real life data larg aircraft mainten compani locat brussel airport belgium the obtain result compar determinist optim straightforward optim experi demonstr model ensur certain desir servic level accept increas labor cost stochast introduc aircraft arriv time aircraft mainten model enhanc stochast optim

All rights reserved.Abstract Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a methodology for evaluating the relative efficiencies of a set of decision-making units (DMUs). The original model is based on the assumption that in a multiple input, multiple output setting, all inputs impact all outputs. In many situations, however, this assumption may not apply, such as would be the case in manufacturing environments where some products may require painting while others would not. In earlier work by the authors, the conventional DEA methodology was extended to allow for efficiency measurement in such situations where partial input-to-output interactions exist. In that methodology all DMUs have identical input/output profiles. It is often the case, however, that these profiles can be different for some DMUs than is true of others. This phenomenon can be prevalent, for example, in manufacturing settings where some plants may use robots for spot welding while other plants may use human resources for that task. Consider a highway maintenance application where consulting services for safety corrections may not be employed on low traffic roadways, but are commonly used on high traffic, multilane highways. Thus, input to output links in the case of some DMUs are missing in the case of others. To address this, the current paper extends the methodology presented earlier by the authors to allow for efficiency measurement in situations where some DMUs have different input/output profiles than is true of others. The new methodology is then applied to the problem of evaluating the efficiencies of a set of road maintenance patrols.","('DEA', 'DMU specific impacts', 'Partial impacts')",partial input output impact dea the case dmu specif impact elsevi b v all right reserv abstract data envelop analysi dea methodolog evalu relat effici set decis make unit dmus the origin model base assumpt multipl input multipl output set input impact output in mani situat howev assumpt may appli would case manufactur environ product may requir paint other would not in earlier work author convent dea methodolog extend allow effici measur situat partial input to output interact exist in methodolog dmus ident input output profil it often case howev profil differ dmus true other this phenomenon preval exampl manufactur set plant may use robot spot weld plant may use human resourc task consid highway mainten applic consult servic safeti correct may employ low traffic roadway common use high traffic multilan highway thus input output link case dmus miss case other to address this current paper extend methodolog present earlier author allow effici measur situat dmus differ input output profil true other the new methodolog appli problem evalu effici set road mainten patrol dea dmu specif impact partial impact

All rights reserved.The wheels are one of the most worn components on a train. When the wear is unacceptable, the re-profiling can restore the shape of the wheel flange with the cost of decreasing the wheel diameter. The decision of re-profiling has serious implications for the life span of wheels. In this paper, based on the analysis of the wear and re-profiling characteristics of metro wheels, a data-driven model of the relationship between the wheel diameter, the flange thickness, their wear rates, and the re-profiling gain is built for the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. A (SdP, SdR) re-profiling strategy is proposed, where SdP is the wheel flange thickness threshold to trigger a preventive re-profiling and SdR is the wheel flange thickness after the preventive re-profiling. Then the Monte Carlo simulation model of the re-profiling strategy is described in this paper. To find out when a re-profiling should be performed in terms of the flange wear-out level and what values of the flange thickness should be brought to by re-profiling, the simulation results for optimizing the decision variables (SdP, SdR) of the re-profiling strategy are given in this paper. Those having longer life spans are listed as the preferred repro filing strategies. The study in this paper reveals that the wear rate of the flange thickness is correlated with the flange thickness, while the diameter wear rate could be considered independent of the flange thickness in terms of the wheels of Guangzhou Metro Line One. On the other hand, based on the observation and analysis of an available sample set from Guangzhou Metro Line One, the re-profiling gain is dependent on the flange thickness before or after re-profiling. The preferred re-profiling strategies suggested by this study can increase the life span comparing with the existing re-profiling strategies based on the simulation. The models and methods presented in this paper could benefit both city metro companies and inter-city rail companies by prolonging the life span of rolling stock wheels.","('Data-driven model', 'Maintenance', 'Metro wheel wear', 'Re-profiling strategy', 'Simulation and optimization')",optim re profil strategi metro wheel base data driven wear model elsevi b v all right reserv the wheel one worn compon train when wear unaccept re profil restor shape wheel flang cost decreas wheel diamet the decis re profil serious implic life span wheel in paper base analysi wear re profil characterist metro wheel data driven model relationship wheel diamet flang thick wear rate re profil gain built wheel guangzhou metro line one a sdp sdr re profil strategi propos sdp wheel flang thick threshold trigger prevent re profil sdr wheel flang thick prevent re profil then mont carlo simul model re profil strategi describ paper to find re profil perform term flang wear out level valu flang thick brought re profil simul result optim decis variabl sdp sdr re profil strategi given paper those longer life span list prefer repro file strategi the studi paper reveal wear rate flang thick correl flang thick diamet wear rate could consid independ flang thick term wheel guangzhou metro line one on hand base observ analysi avail sampl set guangzhou metro line one re profil gain depend flang thick re profil the prefer re profil strategi suggest studi increas life span compar exist re profil strategi base simul the model method present paper could benefit citi metro compani inter citi rail compani prolong life span roll stock wheel data driven model mainten metro wheel wear re profil strategi simul optim

All rights reserved.We address the Flight and Maintenance Planning (FMP) problem, i.e., the problem of deciding which available aircraft to fly and for how long, and which grounded aircraft to perform maintenance operations on in a group of aircraft that comprise a unit. The aim is to maximize the unit fleet availability over a multi-period planning horizon, while also ensuring that certain flight and maintenance requirements are satisfied. Heuristic approaches that are used in practice to solve the FMP problem often perform poorly, generating solutions that are far from the optimum. On the other hand, the exact optimization models that have been developed to tackle the problem handle small problems effectively, but tend to be computationally inefficient for larger problems, such as the ones that arise in practice. With these in mind, we develop an exact solution algorithm for the FMP problem, which is capable of identifying the optimal solution of considerably large realistic problems in reasonable computational times. The algorithm solves suitable relaxations of the original problem, utilizing valid cuts that guide the search towards the optimal solution. We present extensive experimental results, which demonstrate that the algorithm's performance on realistic problems is superior to that of two popular commercial optimization software packages, whereas the opposite is true for a class of problems with special characteristics that deviate considerably from those of realistic problems. The important conclusion of this research is that the proposed algorithm, complemented by generic optimization software, can handle effectively a large variety of FMP problem instances.","('Exact solution algorithm', 'Fleet availability', 'Flight and maintenance planning', 'Mixed integer programming', 'Valid inequalities')",an exact solut algorithm maxim fleet avail unit aircraft subject flight mainten requir elsevi b v all right reserv we address flight mainten plan fmp problem i e problem decid avail aircraft fli long ground aircraft perform mainten oper group aircraft compris unit the aim maxim unit fleet avail multi period plan horizon also ensur certain flight mainten requir satisfi heurist approach use practic solv fmp problem often perform poor generat solut far optimum on hand exact optim model develop tackl problem handl small problem effect tend comput ineffici larger problem one aris practic with mind develop exact solut algorithm fmp problem capabl identifi optim solut consider larg realist problem reason comput time the algorithm solv suitabl relax origin problem util valid cut guid search toward optim solut we present extens experiment result demonstr algorithm s perform realist problem superior two popular commerci optim softwar packag wherea opposit true class problem special characterist deviat consider realist problem the import conclus research propos algorithm complement generic optim softwar handl effect larg varieti fmp problem instanc exact solut algorithm fleet avail flight mainten plan mix integ program valid inequ

Point estimators for these matrices are usually used and they are evaluated using statistical inference methods and/or expert evaluation methods. Thus, considerable epistemic uncertainty often veils the true values of these matrices. Our contribution through this paper is threefold. First, we present a methodology for incorporating epistemic uncertainties in dynamic programming algorithms used to solve finite horizon Markov Decision Processes (which may be partially observable). Second, we propose a methodology based on the use of Dirichlet distributions which answers, in our sense, much of the controversy found in the literature about estimating Markov transition matrices. Third, we show how the complexity resulting from the use of Monte-Carlo simulations for the transition matrices can be greatly overcome in the framework of dynamic programming. The proposed model is applied to concrete bridge under degradation, in order to provide the optimal strategy for inspection and maintenance. The influence of epistemic uncertainties on the optimal solution is underlined through sensitivity analysis regarding the input data.","('Decision analysis', 'Dynamic programming', 'Epistemic uncertainty', 'Maintenance', 'Markov process', 'Uncertainty modeling')",partial observ markov decis process incorpor epistem uncertainti elsevi b v all right reserv the use markov decis process inspect mainten rehabilit civil engin structur reli use sever transit matric relat stochast degrad process mainten action imperfect inspect point estim matric usual use evalu use statist infer method and or expert evalu method thus consider epistem uncertainti often veil true valu matric our contribut paper threefold first present methodolog incorpor epistem uncertainti dynam program algorithm use solv finit horizon markov decis process which may partial observ second propos methodolog base use dirichlet distribut answer sens much controversi found literatur estim markov transit matric third show complex result use mont carlo simul transit matric great overcom framework dynam program the propos model appli concret bridg degrad order provid optim strategi inspect mainten the influenc epistem uncertainti optim solut underlin sensit analysi regard input data decis analysi dynam program epistem uncertainti mainten markov process uncertainti model

All rights reserved.To assess a product's reliability for subsequent managerial decisions such as designing an extended warranty policy and developing a maintenance schedule, Accelerated Degradation Test (ADT) has been used to obtain reliability information in a timely manner. In particular, Step-Stress ADT (SSADT) is one of the most commonly used stress loadings for shortening test duration and reducing the required sample size. Although it was demonstrated in many previous studies that the optimum SSADT plan is actually a simple SSADT plan using only two stress levels, most of these results were obtained numerically on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we formally prove that, under the Wiener degradation model with a drift parameter being a linear function of the (transformed) stress level, a multi-level SSADT plan will degenerate to a simple SSADT plan under many commonly used optimization criteria and some practical constraints. We also show that, under our model assumptions, any SSADT plan with more than two distinct stress levels cannot be optimal. These results are useful for searching for an optimum SSADT plan, since one needs to focus only on simple SSADTs. A numerical example is presented to compare the efficiency of the proposed optimum simple SSADT plans and a SSADT plan proposed by a previous study. In addition, a simulation study is conducted for investigating the efficiency of the proposed SSADT plans when the sample size is small.","('Accelerated Degradation Test', 'Inverse Gaussian distribution', 'Reliability', 'Step-Stress ADT', 'Wiener process')",optimum step stress acceler degrad test wiener degrad process constraint elsevi b v all right reserv to assess product s reliabl subsequ manageri decis design extend warranti polici develop mainten schedul acceler degrad test adt use obtain reliabl inform time manner in particular step stress adt ssadt one common use stress load shorten test durat reduc requir sampl size although demonstr mani previous studi optimum ssadt plan actual simpl ssadt plan use two stress level result obtain numer case by case basi in paper formal prove that wiener degrad model drift paramet linear function transform stress level multi level ssadt plan degener simpl ssadt plan mani common use optim criteria practic constraint we also show that model assumpt ssadt plan two distinct stress level cannot optim these result use search optimum ssadt plan sinc one need focus simpl ssadt a numer exampl present compar effici propos optimum simpl ssadt plan ssadt plan propos previous studi in addit simul studi conduct investig effici propos ssadt plan sampl size small acceler degrad test invers gaussian distribut reliabl step stress adt wiener process

The maintenance scheduling should not only consider individual machine deterioration, but also apply to batch production with variable lot size. An interactive bi-level maintenance strategy is thus proposed in a multi-unit batch production system with degrading machines. In the machine-level scheduling, a multi-attribute model (MAM) is used to obtain maintenance intervals according to individual machine degradation. In the system-level scheduling, a novel production-driven opportunistic maintenance strategy is developed by considering both machine degradation and characteristics of batch production. In this strategy, advance-postpone balancing (APB) utilizes set-up times as opportunities to make real-time schedules for system-level maintenance. The numerical example shows that the proposed MAM-APB methodology can efficiently eliminate unnecessary production breaks, achieve significant cost reduction and overcome complexity of system scheduling.","('Advance-postpone balancing', 'Batch production', 'Cost saving', 'Maintenance', 'Set-up opportunity')",product driven opportunist mainten batch product base mam apb schedul elsevi b v all right reserv nowaday modern product pattern batch product brought new challeng multi unit mainten decis make the mainten schedul consid individu machin deterior also appli batch product variabl lot size an interact bi level mainten strategi thus propos multi unit batch product system degrad machin in machin level schedul multi attribut model mam use obtain mainten interv accord individu machin degrad in system level schedul novel product driven opportunist mainten strategi develop consid machin degrad characterist batch product in strategi advanc postpon balanc apb util set up time opportun make real time schedul system level mainten the numer exampl show propos mam apb methodolog effici elimin unnecessari product break achiev signific cost reduct overcom complex system schedul advanc postpon balanc batch product cost save mainten set up opportun

However, there is very little work on developing suitable imperfect maintenance models for systems outfitted with sensors. Motivated by the practical need of such imperfect maintenance models, the broad objective of this paper is to propose an imperfect maintenance model that is applicable to systems whose sensor information can be modeled by stochastic processes. The proposed imperfect maintenance model is founded on the intuition that maintenance actions will change the rate of deterioration of a system, and that each maintenance action should have a different degree of impact on the rate of deterioration. The corresponding parameter-estimation problem can be divided into two parts: the estimation of fixed model parameters and the estimation of the impact of each maintenance action on the rate of deterioration. The quasi-Monte Carlo method is utilized for estimating fixed model parameters, and the filtering technique is utilized for dynamically estimating the impact from each maintenance action. The competence and robustness of the developed methods are evidenced via simulated data, and the utility of the proposed imperfect maintenance model is revealed via a real data set.","('Degradation rate', 'Improvement factor model', 'Kalman filter', 'Maintenance', 'Quasi-Monte Carlo')",degrad base mainten decis use stochast filter system imperfect mainten elsevi b v all right reserv the notion imperfect mainten spawn larg bodi literatur mani imperfect mainten model develop howev littl work develop suitabl imperfect mainten model system outfit sensor motiv practic need imperfect mainten model broad object paper propos imperfect mainten model applic system whose sensor inform model stochast process the propos imperfect mainten model found intuit mainten action chang rate deterior system mainten action differ degre impact rate deterior the correspond paramet estim problem divid two part estim fix model paramet estim impact mainten action rate deterior the quasi mont carlo method util estim fix model paramet filter techniqu util dynam estim impact mainten action the compet robust develop method evidenc via simul data util propos imperfect mainten model reveal via real data set degrad rate improv factor model kalman filter mainten quasi mont carlo

The main dilemma of maintenance scheduling is to avoid failures while preventing unnecessary maintenance. The technological advancements in real time monitoring and computational science make tracking asset health and forecasting asset failures possible. The usage and maintenance of assets can be planned more efficiently with the forecasted failure probability and remaining useful life (i.e., prognostic information). The prognostic information is time sensitive. Geographically distributed assets such as off-shore wind farms and railway switches add another complexity to the maintenance scheduling problem with the required time of travel to reach these assets. Thus, the travel time between geographically distributed assets should be incorporated in the maintenance scheduling when one technician (or team) is responsible for the maintenance of multiple assets. This paper presents a methodology to schedule the maintenance of geographically distributed assets using their prognostic information. Genetic Algorithm based solution incorporating the daily work duration of the maintenance team is also presented in the paper.","('Distributed assets', 'Maintenance scheduling', 'Prognostics and health management', 'Remaining useful life')",mainten schedul geograph distribut asset prognost inform elsevi b v all right reserv mainten schedul high valu asset studi decad still crucial area research new technolog advanc the main dilemma mainten schedul avoid failur prevent unnecessari mainten the technolog advanc real time monitor comput scienc make track asset health forecast asset failur possibl the usag mainten asset plan effici forecast failur probabl remain use life i e prognost inform the prognost inform time sensit geograph distribut asset off shore wind farm railway switch add anoth complex mainten schedul problem requir time travel reach asset thus travel time geograph distribut asset incorpor mainten schedul one technician or team respons mainten multipl asset this paper present methodolog schedul mainten geograph distribut asset use prognost inform genet algorithm base solut incorpor daili work durat mainten team also present paper distribut asset mainten schedul prognost health manag remain use life

To avoid long downtime of the machines, caused by unexpected failures, preventive maintenance activities are planned and conducted, but if a failure could not be averted a corrective maintenance has to be performed. Both maintenance activities are assumed to restore the machine to be ''as good as new''. The maintenance activities, the number of jobs and their allocation to machines as well as their sequence have a large impact on the performance of the production process and the delivery dates. We study an order of n jobs, scheduled for a frozen period on the machines. It is assumed that jobs, interrupted by machine failure, have to get repeated right after the corrective maintenance is finished (non-resumable case). We first derive an exact formula for the expected makespan. Since the exact evaluation of a schedule is highly complex, we propose two approximations for the expected makespan. The excellent performance of the approximations is illustrated in a numerical study.","('Approximation', 'Maintenance', 'Non-resumable', 'Scheduling', 'Stochastic failures')",evalu expect makespan set non resum job parallel machin stochast failur elsevi b v all right reserv in paper consid product process oper level ident parallel machin subject stochast machin failur to avoid long downtim machin caus unexpect failur prevent mainten activ plan conduct failur could avert correct mainten perform both mainten activ assum restor machin as good new the mainten activ number job alloc machin well sequenc larg impact perform product process deliveri date we studi order n job schedul frozen period machin it assum job interrupt machin failur get repeat right correct mainten finish non resum case we first deriv exact formula expect makespan sinc exact evalu schedul high complex propos two approxim expect makespan the excel perform approxim illustr numer studi approxim mainten non resum schedul stochast failur

In this study, our aim is to develop a fast responsive methodology which provides maintenance feasible routes for each aircraft in the fleet over a weekly planning horizon with the objective of maximizing utilization of the total remaining flying time of fleet.

To model the operational process of the system, some reasonable assumptions are made and all times involved in the assumptions are considered to be arbitrary and independent. Under these assumptions, all system states and transition probabilities between them are analyzed based on a semi-Markov theory and a regenerative point technique. Markov renewal equations are constructed with the convolution of the cumulative distribution function of system time in each state and corresponding transition probability. By using the Laplace transform to solve these equations, the mean time from the initial state to system failure is derived.

Most works in the literature assume that instantaneous replacement is enforced as soon as a defect is detected at an inspection. In contrast, we relax this assumption and allow replacement to be postponed for an additional time period. The key motivation is to achieve better utilization of the system's useful life, and reduce replacement costs by providing a sufficient time window to prepare maintenance resources. We model the preventive replacement cost as a non-increasing function of the postponement interval. We then derive the optimal policy under the modified assumption for a system with exponentially distributed defect arrival time, both for a deterministic delay time and for a more general random delay time. For the settings with a deterministic delay time, we also establish an upper bound on the cost savings that can be attained.

In this article, we are interested in the first issue. We present here many examples of the help that using mathematical programming can provide to decision-makers in the protection of biodiversity. The examples we have chosen concern the selection of nature reserves, the control of adverse effects caused by landscape fragmentation, including the creation or restoration of biological corridors, the ecological exploitation of forests, the control of invasive species, and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Most of the presented models are - or can be approximated with - linear-, quadratic- or fractional-integer formulations and emphasize spatial aspects of conservation planning. Many of them represent decisions taken in a static context but temporal dimension is also considered. The problems presented are generally difficult combinatorial optimization problems, some are well solved and others less well. Research is still needed to progress in solving them in order to deal with real instances satisfactorily. Moreover, relations between researchers and practitioners have to be strengthened.

It is known that measurement error (ME) is a source of uncertainty in the measured data considerably affecting the performance of data driven lifetime estimation. While the effect of ME on the performance of data driven lifetime estimation models has been studied recently, a reversed problem - ""the specification of the ME range to achieve a desirable lifetime estimation performance"" has not been addressed. This problem is related to the usability of the measured health monitoring data for estimating the lifetime. In this paper, we deal with this problem and develop guidelines regarding the formulation of specification limits to the distribution-related ME characteristics. By referring to one widely applied Wiener process-based degradation model, permissible values for the ME bias and standard deviation can be given under a specified lifetime estimation requirement. If the performance of ME does not satisfy the permissible values, the desirable performance for lifetime estimation cannot be ensured by the measured health monitoring data. We further analyze the effect of ME on an age based replacement decision, which is one of the most common and popular maintenance policies in maintenance scheduling.

The operation schedule, which specifies working time of each subsystem, determines the due-date of each maintenance activity and the maintenance schedule specifies the actual start time of each maintenance activity. The main constraints are subsystem requirements, workforce availability, working time limitation, and inter-maintenance time. To represent the problem mathematically, a mixed integer programming model is developed. Then, due to the complexity of the problem, we suggest a heuristic algorithm that minimizes the sum of earliness and tardiness between the due-date and the actual start time for each maintenance activity.

The interdependence between these two activities has not been adequately addressed in the literature, despite their apparent connections. Information obtained in the course of statistical process control signals the need for possible maintenance actions, and thus, affects the preventive maintenance schedules. Preventive maintenance actions can prevent a production process from further deterioration and improve product quality in conjunction with statistical process control. This paper presents an integrated model for the joint optimization of statistical process control and preventive maintenance. The proposed model is developed for a production process that deteriorates according to a discrete-time Markov chain. It is assumed that preventive maintenance is imperfect, and both preventive and corrective maintenance are instantaneous. The formulation of the deterioration process with maintenance interventions, formulated as a Markov chain, provides a breakthrough in designing an efficient solution algorithm and obtaining analytical results. A numerical example is used to illustrate the proposed integrated statistical process control and preventive maintenance policies. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyze the impact of model parameters on optimal policies. Sensitivity analysis further indicates the interrelationship between statistical process control and maintenance actions. Numerical results indicate that potential cost savings can be achieved from the proposed integrated policies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Two models are proposed. The decision criteria for the first model is based on the cost of performing maintenance, the cost of repairing a failed machine and the cost of holding inventory while the machine is not available for production. For the second model the cost of holding inventory is replaced by the cost of not satisfying the demand. The processing time of jobs, inter-arrival times of jobs or units of demand, and the failure times are assumed to be random. The results show that in order to make better maintenance decisions the interaction between the inventory (whether in process or final), and the number of shifts that the machine has been working without restoration, has to be taken into account. If this interaction is considered, the long-run operational costs are reduced significantly. Moreover, structural properties of the optimal policies of the models are obtained after imposing conditions on the parameters of the models and on the distribution of the lifetime of a recently restored machine. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The condition of the process can be in any of several discrete states, and transitions from state to state follow a semi-Markov process. The firm can produce multiple products, which differ by profit earned, expected processing time, and impact on equipment deterioration. The firm can also perform different maintenance actions, which differ by cost incurred, expected down time, and impact on the process condition. The firm needs to determine the optimal production and maintenance choices in each state in a way that maximizes the long-run expected average reward per unit time. The paper makes four contributions: (1) It introduces three critical ratios for the firm's choices. The first enables the firm to decide whether to manufacture or perform maintenance, the second reveals the best product to manufacture, and the third determines the best maintenance action. The economic interpretations of these critical ratios provide managerial insights. (2) The paper shows how the critical ratios can be combined in order to determine the optimal policy, simultaneously accounting for the trade-offs involving production profits, maintenance costs, and the impact on the process condition. We show how these results generalize to problem settings with an arbitrary number of machine states. (3) The paper demonstrates the impact of market demand conditions on the optimal policy.

This paper introduces the Row and Column Selection Algorithm (ROCSA) to select a small but informative dataset for training support vector regression models with standard SVM tools. ROCSA uses -SVR models with L1-norm regularization of the dual and primal variables for the row and column selection steps, respectively. The first step involves parallel processing of data chunks and selects a fraction of the original observations that are either representative of the pattern identified in the chunk, or represent those observations that do not fit the identified pattern. The column selection step dramatically reduces the number of variables and the multicolinearity in the dataset, increasing the interpretability of the resulting models and their ease of maintenance. Evaluated on six retail datasets from two countries and a publicly available research dataset, the reduced ROCSA training data improves the predictive accuracy on average by 39% compared with the original dataset when trained with standard SVM tools.

Accurate RUL estimation can enable failure prevention in a more controllable manner in that effective maintenance can be executed in appropriate time to correct impending faults. In this paper we consider the problem of estimating the RUL from observed degradation data for a general system. A degradation path-dependent approach for RUL estimation is presented through the combination of Bayesian updating and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The use of both Bayesian updating and EM algorithm to update the model parameters and RUL distribution at the time obtaining a newly observed data is a novel contribution of this paper, which makes the estimated RUL depend on the observed degradation data history. As two specific cases, a linear degradation model and an exponential-based degradation model are considered to illustrate the implementation of our presented approach. A major contribution under these two special cases is that our approach can obtain an exact and closed-form RUL distribution respectively, and the moment of the obtained RUL distribution from our presented approach exists. This contrasts sharply with the approximated results obtained in the literature for the same cases. To our knowledge, the RUL estimation approach presented in this paper for the two special cases is the only one that can provide an exact and closed-form RUL distribution utilizing the monitoring history. Finally, numerical examples for RUL estimation and a practical case study for condition-based replacement decision making with comparison to a previously reported approach are provided to substantiate the superiority of the proposed model. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Prognosis consists in this case in computing the distribution of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system conditionally to available information. In so doing, three main challenges arise from the industrial context. First, the model should unify the two classical approaches to describing complex systems: the bottom-up and the top-down approaches. The former uses elementary interacting components whilst the latter models the system's physical behavior by means of a set of differential equations. Second, the prognosis must integrate online information to provide a specific result for each system depending on their life events. Online information can take different forms (e.g. inspections, component faults, non detection or false alarm, noisy signal) which must all be considered. Third, the prognosis must supply ready, meaningful numerical results, the error of which must also be under control. This paper proposes a method addressing those challenges. The method is illustrated with two different examples: a simplified spring-mass system and a pneumatic valve for aeronautical application. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In vacation period, the repairman can perform other secondary jobs to make some extra profits for the system. The lifetimes and the repair times of the device are governed by phase-type distributions (PH distributions), and the condition of device following repair is not ""as good as new"". After a prefixed number of repairs, the device is replaced by a new and identical one. The spare device for replacement is available only by an order and the procurement lead time for delivering the spare device also follows a PH distribution.

Approximations are developed to evaluate the average cost for a given order-up-to level and a given inspection interval and we illustrate the existence of optimal policy parameters.

An (implicit) assumption in virtually all models is that new products to replace the failed ones are immediately available at given replacement costs. Because of the short life cycles of many products, manufacturing may be discontinued before the end of the warranty period. At that point in time, the supplier has to decide how many products to put on the shelf to replace failed products under warranty that will be returned from the field (the last time buy decision). This is a trade-off between product availability for replacement and costs of product obsolescence. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of repair-replacement decisions and the last time buy quantity for products sold under warranty. We develop approximations to estimate the total relevant costs and service levels for this problem, and show that we can easily find near-optimal last time buy quantities using a numerical search.

Yet the cost-efficiency analysis of weapon systems involves several challenges: for example, it is necessary to account for the possible interactions among different weapon systems; the relevance of several impact criteria; and the variety of combat situations in which these systems may be used. In this paper, we develop a portfolio methodology where these challenges are addressed by evaluating the cost-efficiencies of entire portfolios consisting of individual weapon systems. Our methodology accounts for possible interactions among systems by synthesizing impact assessment results that are either generated by combat simulation models or elicited from experts. It also admits incomplete preference information about the relative importance of different impact criteria. This methodology guides decision making by identifying which combinations of weapon systems are efficient with respect to multiple evaluation criteria in different combat situations at different cost levels. It can also be extended to settings where multiple combat situations are addressed simultaneously. The methodology is generic and can therefore be applied also in civilian settings when portfolios of activities (such as mitigation of harmful environmental emissions) may exhibit interactions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These methods generate a trade-off curve of spares investment costs versus backorders. Backorders of spare parts lead to unavailability of the capital goods. Inputs in the spare parts stocking problem are decisions on (1) which components to repair upon failure and which to discard, and (2) at which locations in the repair network to perform the repairs and discards. The level of repair analysis (LORA) can be used to make such decisions in conjunction with the decisions (3) at which locations to deploy resources, such as test equipment that are required to repair, discard, or move components. Since these decisions significantly impact the spare parts investment costs, we propose to solve the LORA and spare parts stocking problems jointly. We design an algorithm that finds efficient solutions. In order for the algorithm to be exact and because of its computational complexity, we restrict ourselves to two-echelon, single-indenture problems. In a computational experiment, we show that solving the joint problem is worthwhile, since we achieve a cost reduction of over 43% at maximum (5.1% on average) compared with using a sequential approach of first solving a LORA and then the spare parts stocking problem. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Motivated by the infant mortality faced by many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMSs), this study develops two degradation-based joint burn-in and maintenance models under the age and the block based maintenances, respectively. We assume that the product population comprises a weak and a normal subpopulations. Degradation of the product follows Wiener processes with linear drift, while the weak and the normal subpopulations possess distinct drift parameters. The objective of joint burn-in and maintenance decisions is to minimize the long run average cost per unit time during field use by properly choosing the burn-in settings and the preventive replacement intervals.

Given that the failures of hard-type components are self-announcing, the component is instantly repaired or replaced, but the failures of soft-type components can only be detected at inspections. A system can operate with a soft failure, but its performance may be reduced. Although a system may be periodically inspected, a hard failure creates an opportunity for additional inspection (opportunistic inspection) of all soft-type components. Two optimization models are discussed in the paper. In the first, soft-type components undergo both periodic and opportunistic inspections to detect possible failures. In the second, hard-type components undergo periodic inspections and are preventively replaced depending on their condition at inspection. Soft-type and hard-type components are either minimally repaired or replaced when they fail. Minimal repair or replacement depends on the state of a component at failure; this, in turn, depends on its age. The paper formulates objective functions for the two models and derives recursive equations for their required expected values. It develops a simulation algorithm to calculate these expected values for a complex model. Several examples are used to illustrate the models and the calculations.

In this problem, a set of workover rigs located at different positions must service oil wells requesting maintenance as soon as possible. When a well requires maintenance, its production is reduced or stopped for safety reasons and some workover rig must service it within a given deadline. It is therefore important to service the wells in a timely fashion in order to minimize the production loss. Whereas for classical VRPTWs the objective is to minimize route length, in the WRRP the objective is to minimize the total lost production, equal to the sum of arrival times at the wells, multiplied by production loss rates. The WRRP generalizes the Delivery Man Problem with Time Windows by considering multiple open vehicle routes and multiple depots.

The objective of a METRIC-based decision problem is to systematically determine the location and quantity of spares that either maximizes the operational availability of a system subject to a budget constraint or minimizes its cost subject to an operational availability target. This type of sparing analysis has proven essential when analyzing the sustainment policies of large-scale, complex repairable systems such as those prevalent in the defense and aerospace industries. Additionally, the frequency of these sparing studies has recently increased as the adoption of performance-based logistics (PBL) has increased. PBL represents a class of business strategies that converts the recurring cost associated with maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) into cost avoidance streams. Central to a PBL contract is a requirement to perform a business case analysis (BCA) and central to a BCA is the frequent need to use METRIC-based approaches to evaluate how a supplier and customer will engage in a performance based logistics arrangement where spares decisions are critical. Due to the size and frequency of the problem there exists a need to improve the efficiency of the computationally intensive METRIC-based solutions. We develop and validate a practical algorithm for improving the computational efficiency of a METRIC-based approach. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are analyzed through a numerical study.

Privatizing some portions of road maintenance operations by state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) under the auspices of performance-based contracts has been one of the innovative initiatives in response to such a need. This paper adapts the non-parametric meta-frontier framework to the two-stage bootstrapping technique to develop an analytical approach for evaluating the relative efficiency of two highway maintenance contracting strategies. The first strategy pertains to the 180 miles of Virginia's Interstate highways maintained by Virginia DOT using traditional maintenance practices. The second strategy pertains to the 250 miles of Virginia's Interstate highways maintained via a Public Private Partnership using a performance-based maintenance approach. The meta-frontier approach accounts for the heterogeneity that exists among different types of highway maintenance contracts due to different limitations and regulations. The two-stage bootstrapping technique accounts for the large set of uncontrollable factors that affect the highway deterioration processes. The preliminary findings, based on the historical data for the state of Virginia, suggest that road authorities (counties) that have used traditional contracting for transforming the maintenance expenditures into the improvement of the road conditions seem to be more efficient than road authorities that have used the performance-based contracting. This paper recommends that road authorities use hybrid contracting approaches that include best practices of both traditional and performance-based highway maintenance contracting. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Maintenance can then be carried out if indicated as necessary by the inspection. This paper considers the design of such multivariate Bayesian control chart where both the transition between states and the relationship between observed information and the state are not Markovian. Since analytical or numerical solutions are difficult for the case considered in this paper, Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the optimal control chart parameters, which are the monitoring interval and the upper control limit.

The main aims are to study different approaches for making a minimal repair decision (i.e.; time-based or condition-based) which is a possible corrective maintenance action under the occurrence of shocks, and to show under a given situation which approach can lead to a greater saving in maintenance cost. Two age-based maintenance policies with age-based minimal repairs and degradation-based minimal repairs are modeled, and their performance is compared with a classical pure age-based replacement policy without minimal repairs. Numerical results show the cost saving of the maintenance policies and allow us to make some conclusions about their performance under different situations of system characteristic and maintenance costs. It is shown that carrying out minimal repairs is useful in many situations to improve the performance of maintenance operations.

This paper proposes a multi-criteria model for auditing a Predictive Maintenance Programme (PMP) developed and implemented in the General Hospital of Ciudad Real (GHCR) in Spain. The model has a two-level structure, with top level auditing areas specified by second level auditing criteria on which the performance of the PMP should be appraised. This structure resulted from the analysis and discussion of an internal questionnaire to the management, technical and consulting staff of GHCR. This also guided the association of a performance scale with each criterion, describing several reference levels of accomplishment. Using the MACBETH (Measuring Attractiveness by a Categorical Based Evaluation Technique) approach, a hierarchical additive value model was constructed, with criteria weights and value scales derived from staff judgments of comparison of different reference levels and profiles of performance. This model enables managers to measure the performance of the PMP and its added value for the hospital, not only against each audit criterion individually, but also on each area and in overall terms. Integrated in a management ""tableau de bord"", the model outputs permit the identification of PMP deficiencies requiring urgent intervention and corrective measures for its continuous improvement. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

As shocks occur, the system has two types of failures. Type-I failure (minor failure) is removed by a general repair, whereas type-II failure (catastrophic failure) is removed by an unplanned replacement. The occurrence of the failure type is based on some random mechanism which depends on the number of shocks occurred since the last replacement. Under an age replacement policy, a planned (or scheduled) replacement happens whenever an operating system reaches age T.

These demands are difficult to predict based on historical data of past spare parts usages, and therefore, the optimal inventory control policy may be also difficult to obtain. However, it is well known that maintenance costs are related to the availability of spare parts and the penalty cost of unavailable spare parts consists of usually the cost of, for example, extended downtime for waiting the spare parts and the emergency expedition cost for acquiring the spare parts. On the other hand, proper planned maintenance intervention can reduce the number of failures and associated costs but its performance also depends on the availability of spare parts. This paper presents the joint optimisation for both the inventory control of the spare parts and the Preventive Maintenance (PM) inspection interval. The decision variables are the order interval, PM interval and order quantity. Because of the random nature of plant failures, stochastic cost models for spare parts inventory and maintenance are derived and an enumeration algorithm with stochastic dynamic programming is employed for finding the joint optimal solutions over a finite time horizon. The delay-time concept developed for inspection modelling is used to construct the probabilities of the number of failures and the number of the defective items identified at a PM epoch, which has not been used in this type of problems before. The inventory model follows a periodic review policy but with the demand governed by the need for spare parts due to maintenance.

Its estimation is central to condition based maintenance and prognostics and health management. RUL is typically random and unknown, and as such it must be estimated from available sources of information such as the information obtained in condition and health monitoring. The research on how to best estimate the RUL has gained popularity recently due to the rapid advances in condition and health monitoring techniques. However, due to its complicated relationship with observable health information, there is no such best approach which can be used universally to achieve the best estimate. As such this paper reviews the recent modeling developments for estimating the RUL. The review is centred on statistical data driven approaches which rely only on available past observed data and statistical models. The approaches are classified into two broad types of models, that is, models that rely on directly observed state information of the asset, and those do not.

The goal is to achieve the lowest possible life cycle costs. Various models exist for the LORA problem. However, they tend to be restrictive in that specific business situations cannot be incorporated, such as having repair equipment with finite capacity or the occurrence of unsuccessful repairs or no-fault-founds.

A new two-factor evaluation function is introduced to quantify decisions on asset replacement under a unique cycle environment. This study improves upon previous findings in the literature as it accounts for autonomous salvage value processes. Based on partial differential equations, this model achieves a general analytical solution and particular numerical solution. The results differ significantly from those observed in one-factor models by showing evidence of over-evaluation in optimal levels of replacement, and by confirming suspicions that different types of uncertainties produce non-monotonous effects on the optimal replacement level.

The released signals are used to inform opportunistic maintenance. The model provides a framework for the determination of the underlying system lifetime from right-censored data, without requiring explicit assumptions about the type of censoring to be made. The parameters of the model are estimated from observational data by using maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate the estimation process through a simulation study. The proposed signal model can be used to support decision-making in optimising preventive maintenance: at a component level, estimates of the underlying failure distribution can be used to identify the critical signal that would trigger maintenance of the individual component; at a multi-component system level, accurate estimates of the component underlying lifetimes are important when making general maintenance decisions.

Equipment capital costs for a given operation are usually within the order of hundreds of million dollars but may reach to billion dollars for large companies operating multiple mines. Such large investments require the optimum usage of equipment in a manner that the operating costs are minimized and the utilization of equipment is maximized through optimal scheduling. This optimum usage is required to ensure that the business remains sustainable and financially stable. Most mining operations utilize trucks to haul the mined material. Maintenance is one of the major operating cost items for these fleets as it can reach approximately one hundred million dollars yearly. There is no method or application in the literature that optimizes the utilization for truck fleet over the life of mine. A new approach based on mixed integer programming (MIP) techniques is used for annually scheduling a fixed fleet of mining trucks in a given operation, over a multi-year time horizon to minimize maintenance cost. The model uses the truck age (total hours of usage), maintenance cost and required operating hours to achieve annual production targets to produce an optimum truck schedule. While this paper focuses on scheduling trucks for mining operation, concept can be used in most businesses using equipment with significant maintenance costs. A case study for a large scale gold mine showed an annual discounted (10% rate) maintenance cost saving of over $2M and more than 16% ($21M) of overall maintenance cost reduction over 10 years of mine life, compared with the spreadsheet based approach used currently at the operation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Currently there are no effective methods which can predict a hidden failure of a system real-time when there exist influences from the changes of environmental factors and there is no such an accurate mathematical model for the system prognosis due to its intrinsic complexity and operating in potentially uncertain environment. Therefore, this paper focuses on developing a new hidden Markov model (HMM) based method which can deal with the problem. Although an accurate model between environmental factors and a failure process is difficult to obtain, some expert knowledge can be collected and represented by a belief rule base (BRB) which is an expert system in fact. As such, combining the HMM with the BRB, a new prognosis model is proposed to predict the hidden failure real-time even when there are influences from the changes of environmental factors. In the proposed model, the HMM is used to capture the relationships between the hidden failure and monitored observations of a system. The BRB is used to model the relationships between the environmental factors and the transition probabilities among the hidden states of the system including the hidden failure, which is the main contribution of this paper. Moreover, a recursive algorithm for online updating the prognosis model is developed. An experimental case study is examined to demonstrate the implementation and potential applications of the proposed real-time failure prognosis method. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Both machines deteriorate stochastically with usage and may fail. For each machine the deteriorating process is described by some known transition probabilities between different degrees of deterioration. A buffer has been built between the two machines in order to cope with unexpected failures of the installation. A discrete-time Markov decision model is formulated for the optimal preventive maintenance of both machines. The maintenance times are geometrically distributed and the cost structure includes operating costs, storage costs, maintenance costs and costs due to the lost production. It is proved that for fixed buffer content and for fixed deterioration degree of one machine, the average-cost optimal policy initiates a preventive maintenance of the other machine if and only if its degree of deterioration exceeds some critical level. We study, by means of numerical results, the effect of the variation of some parameters on the optimal policy and on the minimum average cost.

The heterogeneous nature of components implies a mixed distribution for time to failure. In these circumstances, a hybrid policy comprising two phases, an early inspection phase and a later wear-out replacement phase, may be appropriate. The policy has some similarity to burn-in maintenance. The simplest policy described is such a hybrid and comprises a block-type or periodic replacement policy with an embedded block or periodic inspection policy. We use a three state failure model, in which a component may be good, defective or failed, in order to consider inspection maintenance. Hybrid block replacement and age-based inspection, and opportunistic hybrid policies will also arise naturally in these circumstances and these are briefly investigated. For the simplest policy, an approximation is used to determine the long-run cost and the system reliability. The policies have the interesting property that the system reliability may be a maximum when the long-run cost is close to its minimum. The failure model implies that the effect of maintenance is heterogeneous. The policies themselves imply that maintenance is carried out more prudently to newer than to older systems. The maintenance of traction motor bearings on underground trains is used to illustrate the ideas in the paper. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This is typically applied to the situation where the OEM is the only possible service supplier such as in the case of major military equipment in the defense sector. Three contract options were considered, depending on the extent of outsourced maintenance activities. From an agent point of view, they are, (1), the agent carries out all repairs and inspections; (2), the agent carries out failure based repairs, and (3), the agent does inspections and repairs to the defects identified at inspections. For options two and three, the customer does the rest of maintenance. The relationship between inspections and failures was modeled using the delay time concept and a numerical example was illustrated. The cases of perfect information to both parties and information asymmetry were also discussed in the example.

The quickest path problem thus arises to find a single path with minimum transmission time. More specifically, the capacity of each arc is assumed to be deterministic. However, in many real-life networks such as computer networks and telecommunication networks, the capacity of each arc is stochastic due to failure, maintenance, etc. Hence, the minimum transmission time is not a fixed number. Such a network is named a stochastic-flow network. In order to reduce the transmission time, the network allows the data to be transmitted through k minimal paths simultaneously. Including the cost attribute, this paper evaluates the probability that d units of data can be transmitted under both time threshold T and budget B. Such a probability is called the system reliability. An efficient algorithm is proposed to generate all of lower boundary points for (d, T, B), the minimal capacity vectors satisfying the demand, time, and budget requirements. The system reliability can then be computed in terms of such points. Moreover, the optimal combination of k minimal paths with highest system reliability can be obtained. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The two machines, which are prone to random failures, undergo preventive and corrective maintenance operations. These operations with a random duration make the machines unavailable. Moreover, during regular subcontracting operations, one of these machines becomes unavailable to supply the downstream inventory. In the first strategy it is assumed that the periodicity of preventive maintenance operations and the production rate of each machine are independent. The second strategy suggests an interaction between the periods of unavailability and the production rates of the two machines in order to minimize production losses during these periods. A simulation model for each strategy is developed so as to be able to compare them and to simultaneously determine the timing of preventive maintenance on each machine considering the total average cost per time unit as the performance criterion.

This means, for example, that if DMU j1 generates twice as much of an output as does another DMU j2, then the former is credited with having created twice as much value. In many situations, however, linear pricing (μr yrj) may not adequately reflect differences in value created from one DMU to another. In this paper, a generalization of the DEA methodology is presented that incorporates piecewise linear functions of factors. We deal specifically with those situations where for certain outputs in an input-oriented model, the weight function f (yrj) is described by either a non-increasing or non-decreasing set of multipliers for larger amounts of the factor. We refer to such a variable r as exhibiting diminishing marginal value (DMV) or increasing marginal value (IMV). The DMV/IMV phenomenon is common in many for-profit applications. For example, in the case that yrj is the amount of a consumer product r generated by DMU j, and μr is the price of that product, it may well be that the market will force lower prices if greater amounts of that product are generated; discounts automatically lead to this DMV situation. Such a phenomenon can arise as well in not-for-profit settings, and we examine such a situation based on earlier work by Cook et al. [Cook, W.D., Roll, Y., Kazakov, A., 1990.

The preventive maintenance is imperfect because it reduces the failure rate of the maintainable failures but does not affect the failure rate of the non-maintainable failures. The two failure modes are dependent in the following way: after each preventive maintenance, the failure rate of the maintainable failures depends on the total of non-maintainable failures since the installation of the system.

Various control charts such as Hotelling's T2, EWMA and CUSUM charts have been developed for multivariate quality control, where the values of the chart parameters, namely the sample size, sampling interval and the control limits are determined to satisfy given economic and/or statistical requirements. It is well known that this traditional non-Bayesian approach to a control chart design is not optimal, but very few results regarding the form of the optimal Bayesian control policy have appeared in the literature, all limited to a univariate chart design. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bayesian process mean control problem for a finite production run under the assumption that the observations are values of independent, normally distributed vectors of random variables. The problem is formulated in the POMDP (partially observable Markov decision process) framework and the objective is to determine a control policy minimizing the total expected cost. It is proved that under standard operating and cost assumptions the control limit policy is optimal. Cost comparisons with the benchmark chi-squared chart and the MEWMA chart show that the Bayesian chart is highly cost effective, the savings are larger for smaller values of the critical Mahalanobis distance between the in-control and out-of-control process mean. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Starting with an abstract model and using the approach of optimal control, initially we characterize the various types of equipment by assigning to them a single total profit index, which indicates how the above policies affect the flow of operating revenues plus capital gains or losses. This index is a function of market-determined prices. So using it we then investigate how the operating and capital policies are influenced by the rate of discount, the price of new equipment, and the rise or fall of the price of new equipment relative to the value of its output. Among other interesting results, we find that the effects of these prices on the nature and interactions of optimal policies depend crucially on whether the equipment is of the usual profit making type, where output is the main source of revenue, or of the antique type, where the main source of revenue is capital gains. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It combines the condition-based replacement policy with periodical inspections and the (S, s) type inventory policy, noted as the (T, S, s, Lp) policy, where T is the inspection interval, S is the maximum stock level, s is the reorder level, and Lp is the preventive replacement threshold for the deterioration levels of units. The deterioration level of each unit in the system can be described by a scalar random variable, which is continuous and increasing monotonically. Furthermore, the deterioration level just when the unit failure occurs, termed deterioration to failure, is uncertain. Therefore, the condition-based reliability is proposed in order to characterize various and uncertain deterioration levels when unit failure occurs. A simulation model is developed for the system operation under the proposed condition-based replacement and spare provisioning policy. Thus, via the simulation method and the genetic algorithm, the decision variables T, S, s, and Lp can be jointly optimized for minimizing the cost rate.

Often, the agent (service provider) offers more than one option and the owners of equipment (customers) are faced to the problem of selecting the optimal option, under the terms of a contract. In the current work, we develop a model and report results to determine the agent's optimal strategy for a given type of contract. The model derives in a non-cooperative game formulation in which the decisions are taken by maximizing expected profits. This work extends previous models by considering the realistic case of equipments having an increasing failure intensity due to imperfect maintenance, instead of the standard assumption that considers failure times are exponentially distributed (constant failure intensity). We develop a model using a linear function of time to characterize the failure intensity. The main goal, for the agent, is to determine the pricing structure in the contract and the number of customers to service. On the other hand, for the clients, the main goal is to define the period between planned actions for preventive maintenance and the time to replace equipments. In order to give a complete characterization of the results, we also carry out a sensitivity analysis over some of the factors that would influence over the failure intensity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

When the chart signals, full inspection is performed to determine the actual machine condition. The system can be preventively replaced at a sampling epoch and must be replaced upon failure; preventive replacement costs less than failure replacement.

The CLV plays a key role in customer acquisition and retention decisions. In this paper, we present a general mathematical framework for RM, and introduce a Markov chain model which is appropriate in modeling RM because of its flexibility and probabilistic nature. We also develop the life distribution of the customer relationship, which is a phase-type distribution since it is the distribution of the first arrival stopping state. And we obtain the expectation of the CLV, which is an important statistic for good decision-making. Finally, we illustrate how to find the optimal remarketing policy numerically.

As is often the case in real manufacturing applications, maintenance activities are imperfect and unable to restore the system to its original healthy state.

The second stage is called the failure delay period, since a defect may be initiated, and progressively develop into an actual failure, i.e., the equipment is in a defective stage but still working during this stage. With the help of condition monitoring, hidden defects already present in the equipment may be detected, but for maintenance planning purposes, the prediction of the initiation point of the second stage, and more importantly, the residual life thereafter is important.

We present Bayesian semiparametric models to estimate the failure time distribution and costs involved. The objective function for the optimization is the expected total cost of maintenance over the pre-defined finite time horizon. Typically, the mathematical modeling of failure times are based on parametric models. These models fail to capture the true underlying relationships in the data; indeed, under a parametric assumption, the hazard rates are treated as unimodal, which, as shown in this paper, is incorrect. Importantly, assuming an increasing failure rate, as is typically done, we show, is way off the mark in the present context. Since hazard and cost estimates feed into the optimization phase, from a risk management perspective, potentially gross errors, resulting from purely parametric models, can be obviated.

This paper deals with the application of a multicriteria analysis (MCA) approach to urban stormwater drainage management. Stormwater source control has become a popular alternative solution for managing stormwater in urban areas. Source control constitutes one variant of best management practices (BMPs) that can be evaluated with respect to various criteria, including: hydraulic efficiency, pollution retention, environmental impact, operation and maintenance, economic investment, and social and sustainable urban living. A French survey was undertaken to assess the performance of different BMPs at the national scale; results highlight the main reasons justifying the use of BMPs. These reasons are primarily related to flood prevention, which far outweighs the economic incentives. Moreover, hydraulic and technical aspects are most frequently noted by users, whereas operation and maintenance aspects are often seen as obstacles to application of these techniques. The survey results, completed by a literature review and expert statements, have been used to establish a matrix of alternatives for multicriteria analysis. The MCA results obtained allow ranking the various alternatives from best to worst, taking into account the different strategies adopted by the decision-makers involved. The development of a multicriteria approach could, in the future, serve as a supporting decision-aid tool, whose purpose would be to guide users in their choice of stormwater source solution. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional preventive maintenance policies, such as age and periodic replacements, are usually studied based on simplified and non-realistic assumptions, as well as on the expected costs criterion. Finished goods inventories and the age-dependent likelihood of machine breakdowns are usually not considered. As a result, these policies could significantly extend beyond the anticipated financial incomes of the system, and lead to crises. In order to solve this problem, a more realistic analysis model is proposed in this paper to consider the effects of both preventive maintenance policies and machine age on optimal safety stock levels. Hence, a unified framework is developed, allowing production and preventive maintenance to be jointly considered. We use an age-dependent optimization model based on the minimization of an overall cost function, including inventory holdings, lost sales, preventive and corrective maintenance costs. We provide optimality conditions for the manufacturing systems considered, and use numerical methods to obtain an optimal preventive maintenance policy and the relevant age-dependent threshold level production policy. In this work, this policy is called the multiple threshold levels hedging point policy. We include numerical examples and sensitivity analyses to illustrate the importance and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

The workforce that performs these tasks are often high-paid, which means the task scheduling should minimize worker idle time. Idle time can always be minimized by reducing the workforce. However, all preventive maintenance tasks should be completed as quickly as possible to make equipment available. This means the completion time should be also minimized. Unfortunately, a small workforce cannot complete many maintenance tasks per hour. Hence, there is a tradeoff: should the workforce be small to reduce idle time or should it be large so more maintenance can be performed each hour? A cost effective schedule should strike some balance between a minimum schedule and a minimum size workforce. This paper uses evolutionary algorithms to solve this multiobjective problem. However, rather than conducting a conventional dominance-based Pareto search, we introduce a form of utility theory to find Pareto optimal solutions. The advantage of this method is the user can target specific subsets of the Pareto front by merely ranking a small set of initial solutions.

The introduction of high speed networks and the increased traffic levels on suburban routes and freight lines require new technologies for both railway infrastructure and trains, all of which must be subjected to rigorous quality control before and during operation and must be supported with effective maintenance processes during their operating lives. Safety in railway infrastructure provision must be ensured by all the main components operating reliably all the time. From an economic, quality and safety point of view, points are probably one of the most critical infrastructure elements in railway transportation. Most problems with points mechanisms are associated with either wear of components or movements of the sleepers and rails resulting from the normal behaviour of ballasted track. Therefore, railway points require regular adjustment to compensate for wear in switch rails, cams, hinges of linkages and detection switches. Consequently, a dependable method of wear control is required. Ideally, this should involve only minimal human intervention, particularly with regard to wear of the tracks. The method for assessing wear proposed in this paper is based on a robust remote monitoring system. It involves the collection and transmission of time varying data and the analysis of the signals. The authors put forward models to monitor wear based on the signal analysed for detecting the state of points mechanisms. The models explored in this paper in real time belong to the so called Unobserved Components class of models, set up in a State Space framework. The unknown elements in the system matrices are estimated by a maximum likelihood algorithm, and they are generally updated each time new data becomes available. The system developed has been tested in numerous experiments to demonstrate its efficiency and it is able to find potential hazards. Typical wear-inducing faults were introduced intentionally during the experiments on which the present paper is based. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

When the wear reaches a certain level the unit is no longer able to function satisfactorily and needs to be replaced. Although units are produced to the same nominal specification there is still some random variation among them in their wear rates. This will be expressed by incorporating a random effect, or frailty term, in the model for individual degradation. There are costs for observing the wear on a unit, for replacing a unit, and for allowing a unit to fail before being replaced. When the last cost is comparatively large replacement before failure is preferable.

We focus on the problem of aircraft routing, which involves generating and selecting a particular route for each aircraft of a sub-fleet that is already assigned to a set of feasible sequences of flight legs. Similar studies typically focus on long-term route planning. However, stochastic events such as severe weather changes, equipment failures, variable maintenance times, or even new regulations mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) play havoc on these long-term plans. In addition, these long-term plans ignore detailed maintenance requirements by considering only one or two of the primary maintenance checks that must be performed on a regular, long-term basis. As a result, these plans are often ignored by personnel in airline operations who are forced on a daily basis to develop quick, ad hoc methods to address these maintenance requirements and other irregular events. To address this problem, we develop an operational aircraft maintenance routing problem formulation that includes maintenance resource availability constraints. We propose a branch-and-price algorithm for solving this problem, which, due to the resource constraints, entails a modification of the branch-on, follow-on branching rule typically used for solving similar problems. Through computational testing, we explore the efficiency of this solution approach under a combination of heuristic choices for column (route) generation and selection. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

As shocks occur the system has two types of failure: type I failure (minor) or type II failure (catastrophic). A generalization of the age replacement policy for such a system is proposed and analyzed in this study. Under such a policy, if an operating system suffers a shock and fails at age y (≤t), it is either replaced by a new system (type II failure) or it undergoes minimal repair (type I failure). Otherwise, the system is replaced when the first shock after t arrives, or the total operating time reaches age T (0 ≤ t ≤ T), whichever occurs first. The occurrence of those two possible actions occurring during the period [0, t] is based on some random mechanism which depends on the number of shocks suffered since the last replacement.

This model provides an additional possibility of identifying where, why and how much capital should be invested, and judges whether or not the investment was cost-effective. The model is further utilised to develop relevant maintenance performance measures. When the model was tested in a Swedish paper mill, the main results were: the average yearly maintenance profit achieved using integrated VBM was at least 3.58 million Swedish kronor (SEK) (approximately US$0.358 million), and average potential savings (economic losses) were around SEK 30 million (US$3 million). Furthermore, the model facilitated identification of problem areas and recognition of where investments should be made. The major conclusion is that the better the data coverage and quality, the greater control is possible over direct maintenance costs, savings and further profits in maintenance.

Preventive maintenance actions are regularly performed on the production unit at instants T,2T,3T,... The corrective and preventive maintenance actions have random durations. In order to palliate perturbations caused by breakdowns and by planned maintenance actions, a buffer stock is built up to ensure the continuous supply of the assembly line at a constant rate β. To build up this buffer stock, the production unit produces at a rate α + β. The proposed strategy consists in building up, at the beginning of each preventive maintenance cycle, a buffer stock whose size 'S' covers at least the average consumption during the repair periods following breakdowns within the period of length T. At the instant T when the production unit has to be stopped to undertake the planned preventive maintenance actions, a certain level of buffer stock must still be available in order to avoid stoppage of the subsequent assembly line. A mathematical model has been developed for this strategy. It takes into account the probability distributions associated to lifetime, repair time, preventive maintenance duration, as well as the renewal process associated to the operation-repair cycles of the production unit. The optimum values of the decision variables 'S' and 'T' are obtained by trading off the maintenance cost, the inventory holding cost, and the shortage cost such as their sum is minimum. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

They may be solved by using classical dynamic programming (DP) methods. However, DP methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and break down rapidly in face of large state-spaces. In addition, DP methods require the exact computation of the so-called transition probabilities, which are often hard to obtain and are hence said to suffer from the curse of modeling as well. In recent years, a simulation-based method, called reinforcement learning (RL), has emerged in the literature. It can, to a great extent, alleviate stochastic DP of its curses by generating 'near-optimal' solutions to problems having large state-spaces and complex transition mechanisms. In this paper, a simulation-based algorithm that solves Markov and SMDPs is presented, along with its convergence analysis. The algorithm involves a step-size based transformation on two-time scales. Its convergence analysis is based on a recent result on asynchronous convergence of iterates on two-time scales. We present numerical results from the new algorithm on a classical preventive maintenance case study of a reasonable size, where results on the optimal policy are also available. In addition, we present a tutorial that explains the framework of RL in the context of long-run average cost SMDPs. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The deterioration is modeled by a Gamma process. The system is considered as failed if its condition jumps above a pre-set failure level. Two types of replacement can take place at each inspection date depending on whether the current system state is above a pre-set critical threshold but not failed or in the failed state. This paper is focused on the development of a new probabilistic method based on the semi-regenerative property of the evolution process in order to calculate the long-time expected cost per unit of time. We use a recent result generalizing the well-known theorem usually used which says that the cost criterion is equal to the ratio of the expected cost on a renewal cycle over the expected cycle duration. Numerical experiments show that there exists a set of parameters (the critical threshold and the parameters of the maintenance scheduling function) which lead to a minimal cost. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The deterioration degree is measured with a finite discrete scale; repairs follow general distributions; failures are instantaneously detected. This system is submitted to a preventive maintenance policy, with a sequential checking procedure: the up-states are divided into two parts, the ""good"" up-states and the ""degraded"" up-states. Instantaneous (and perfect) inspections are then performed on the running system: when it is found in a degraded up-state, it is stopped to be maintained (for a random duration that depends on the degradation degree of the system); when it is found in a good up-state, it is left as it is. The next inspection epoch is then chosen randomly and depends on the degradation degree of the system by time of inspection. We compute the long-run availability of the maintained system and give sufficient conditions for the preventive maintenance policy to improve the long-run availability. We study the optimization of the long-run availability with respect to the distributions of the inter-inspection intervals: we show that under specific assumptions (often checked), optimal distributions are non-random.

A system is subject to shocks that arrive according to a non-homogeneous Poisson process. As shocks occur a system has two types of failures. Type 1 failure (minor failure) is removed by a minimal repair, whereas type 2 failure (catastrophic failure) is removed by an unplanned (or unscheduled) replacement. After a replacement the shock process resets at 0. Under such a policy, an operating system is preventively replaced by new ones at times iT (i = 1,2,...) independently of its failure history. If system fails in ((i - 1)T,iT - δ) it is either replaced by a new one or minimally repaired, and if in [iT - δ,iT) it is either replaced by a used one or minimally repaired. The choice of these two possible actions is based on some random mechanism which depends on the number of shocks since the last replacement. The expected cost rate is obtained, using the results of the renewal reward theory. Various special cases are considered.

For public sector applications like salt spreading and road maintenance, this partitioning is a real distinct stage in the organization and planning of services, and as is the case with location, districting is of a non-operational nature. Relevant characteristics of well-designed districts are: ability to support good routing, balance in workload, compactness of the sub-areas, centrality of the depot, etc. We present a heuristic procedure for our districting problem.

This ""clone-based"" modeling approach allows the continued use of optimization models with minimal mathematical programming understanding, as generation of mathematical model by clones is hidden and automatic, therefore maintenance-free: Updating graphical production system models is enough for renewing internal optimization models.

During the planning time period whenever pipe leaks are detected in a section, repair actions are undertaken until the funds assigned to the section are exhausted. In practice, funds are usually allocated to each pipe section based on the expected number of leak occurrences, leak size and leak duration or the expected leak volume. The allocation of limited repair funds to different pipe sections is however, frequently done without accurate quantitative analysis that carefully considers random events. In this paper, a mathematical model that considers explicitly the randomness of the time interval between leak occurrences and leak durations is developed and proposed for city authorities to ascertain the assignment of optimal funds for pipe repair maintenance operations. The objective of the proposed model is to maximize the net benefit, defined as the benefit gained from water saving due to repair fund allocation minus the allocated repair funds. The model is extended to determine the optimal allocation of the limited repair funds to different sections of the network, by applying a Lagrangian relaxation method to find an optimal solution. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, in industry applications, it is very common for a machine to be in subnormal condition after running for a certain period of time. Motivated by a problem commonly found in the surface-mount technology of electronic assembly lines, this paper deals with scheduling problems involving repair and maintenance rate-modifying activities. When a machine is running at less than an efficient speed, a production planner can decide to stop the machine and maintain it or wait and maintain it later. If the choice is made to continue running the machine without fixing it, it is possible that the machine will break down and repair will be required immediately. Both maintenance and repair activities can change the machine speed from a sub-normal production rate to a normal one. Hence, we call them rate-modifying activities. Our purpose here is to simultaneously sequence jobs and schedule maintenance activity to optimize regular performance measures. In this paper, we assume that processing time is deterministic, while machine break down is a random process following certain distributions. We consider two types of processing cases: resumable and nonresumable. We study problems with objective functions such as expected makespan, total expected completion time, maximum expected lateness, and expected maximum lateness, respectively. Several interesting results are obtained, especially for the nonresumable case. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A number of research studies have addressed these selection and sequencing problems by essentially solving each problem independent of the other. The selection problem considers the maximization of the number of assembled nozzles that are feasible with respect to exit area requirements. Whereas, the sequencing problem considers the assignment of vanes, such that the variation in the throat area between adjacent vanes is minimized. However, the ability to obtain a sequence of vanes with a reasonably low variation in adjacent throat areas can, and often does, depend largely on the vanes that have been selected. Consequently, we propose and develop a selection methodology that not only accounts for feasibility with respect to exit area constraints, but also for the impact on the variation of the resulting sequence of vanes. The proposed methods are empirically compared to those of previous studies.

Simulated annealing is applied for solving this reconfiguration problem. The supply network is comprised of distribution centers that are geographically distributed and have differing operating and maintenance cost structures on distribution-related resources. The distribution planning methodology employed in the heuristics has two phases: Phase one incorporates a strategic-based decision making step in which the `best' set of distribution centers are selected open; Phase two incorporates an operationally-based decision making step in which the heuristics perturb the customer assignments and resource assignments. The heuristics are tested on a set of 450 problems of various sizes and structures. Computational results suggest that the simulated annealing heuristics generate near optimal solutions quickly and are well suited for evaluating supply network reconfiguration.

These three aspects must be jointly dealt with, considering both quantitative and qualitative classifications which cover economic and technical requirements of the project design. The available tools for design and simulation of power plants, provide support for technical quantitative analysis. However, they do not support the design qualitatively. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a decision support system in a power plant simulation tool, in order to provide the qualitative synthesis needed for the plant design process, and also to assist the design engineers in performing a better choice-evaluation of the aspects described previously.

Since the operating state of a production system is often subject to fluctuations in time, the planning of preventive maintenance at preset points in time (e.g. age/block replacement) cannot be optimal. Therefore, we propose a so-called two-stage maintenance policy, which - in a first stage - uses the technical state of the production system to determine a finite interval [t, t + Δt] during which preventive maintenance must be carried out, and - in a second stage - uses the operating state of the production system to determine the optimal starting time t̂ for preventive maintenance within that interval. A generalized age maintenance policy optimizing both t and Δt is formulated in the first stage. To this end, the actual starting time of preventive maintenance is modelled in terms of a uniform distribution over the maintenance interval. Moreover, the expected costs of preventive maintenance are modelled as a decreasing function of the interval size.

As shocks occur a system has two types of failures. Type I failure (minor failure) is removed by a minimal repair, whereas type II failure (catastrophic failure) is removed by an unplanned (or unscheduled) replacement. The choice of these two possible actions is based on some random mechanism which depends on the number of shocks suffered since the last replacement. For an age replacement maintenance policy, planned (or scheduled) replacements occur whenever an operating system reaches age T, whereas in the block replacement case, planned replacements occur every T units of time. The aim of this paper is to derive the expressions for the expected long-run cost per unit time and the total α-discounted cost for each policy.

A state space model is used to predict the erosion condition of the inductors in an induction furnace in which a measure of the conductance ratio (CR) is used to indirectly assess the relative condition of the inductors, and to guide replacement decisions. This study seeks to improve on this decision process by establishing the relationship between CR and the erosion condition of the inductors. To establish such a relationship, a state space model has been established and the system parameters estimated from CR data. A replacement cost model to balance at any time costly replacements with possible catastrophic failure is also proposed based upon the predicted probability of inductor erosion conditional upon all available information. The well known Kalman filter is employed to derive the predicted and updated probability of inductor erosion level conditional upon CR data to date. This is the first time the condition monitoring decision process has been modelled for real plant based upon filtering theory.

Grouping activities thus saves costs since execution of a group of activities requires only one set-up. Many maintenance models consider the grouping of maintenance activities on a long-term basis with an infinite horizon. This makes it very difficult to incorporate short-term circumstances such as opportunities or a varying use of components because these are either not known beforehand or make the problem intractable. In this paper we propose a rolling-horizon approach that takes a long-term tentative plan as a basis for a subsequent adaptation according to information that becomes available on the short term. This yields a dynamic grouping policy that assists the maintenance manager in his planning job.

Low earth orbit satellite (LEOS) based communication systems are a new and exciting endeavor in reshaping the global communication network and the services that it provides. Huge investments are made in the development of LEOS systems, and larger amounts will be needed for their ongoing operation and use. Many LEOS based systems have been announced over the last decade. Globalstar, Iridium, Orbcomm and Teledesic are just a few of the many systems under development with the aim of providing global communication services to the masses. Limited experience exists in developing and managing large scale commercial satellite based mobile communication systems, which makes it a very risky business. Many open, interesting and challenging research issues are faced by the designers of such systems. This paper presents LEOS based communication systems, analyzes their economic viability, and discusses some of the important research areas involved in their development, configuration, maintenance, operation and management.

The algorithm searches for a simple rule per component in order to minimise long-run average cost per unit of time for the system as a whole. This opportunistic rule per component has a simple structure: it consists of an upper limit inducing mandatory repair and of several lower limits. Each lower limit corresponds to the potential for saving an amount of repair costs when an opportunity for a specific coordination presents itself.

Two models are considered in this paper based on the timing of acquisition of private information by the managers.

This paper analyzes the performance of an inspection and maintenance policy that begins 100% sampling of a production lot after producing n parts and then initiates a preventive/corrective maintenance activity when the fraction of bad parts in the sample reaches a given threshold f*. The decision maker must select n and f* to achieve an economic trade-off among the costs of sampling, inspection, maintenance, scrap, and lost production. This paper derives the fundamental performance measures required to assess these costs as a function of n and f*. A numerical study using hypothetical data is used to illustrate the application of the model. Sensitivity analyses indicate the effects of changes in key input parameters on the optimal solution. This research shows the optimal policy is sensitive to some input parameters, such as the input rate of parts, the process switch rate, the quality control cost, and the probability of producing defective parts. Consequently, more effort should be made to obtain accurate estimates of these parameters. Moreover, the optimal quality control and maintenance policy is insensitive to the variance of the process stoppage time. Hence, even though one might have difficulty in estimating or specifying the probability distribution functions of the process inspection time, the preventive maintenance time, or the repair maintenance time, the optimal final decision will not be affected greatly as long as the mean values of these times are available. Finally, when the design of a process capacity is considered, it is important to take into account the requirements for quality control, process inspection, and process maintenance. © 1995.","('M/G/1 queue', 'Maintenance policy', 'On-line sampling', 'Preventive maintenance', 'Quality control')",design optim mainten polici base on line sampl plan this paper concern design optim qualiti control mainten polici base on line sampl plan this paper analyz perform inspect mainten polici begin sampl product lot produc n part initi prevent correct mainten activ fraction bad part sampl reach given threshold f the decis maker must select n f achiev econom trade off among cost sampl inspect mainten scrap lost product this paper deriv fundament perform measur requir assess cost function n f a numer studi use hypothet data use illustr applic model sensit analys indic effect chang key input paramet optim solut this research show optim polici sensit input paramet input rate part process switch rate qualiti control cost probabl produc defect part consequ effort made obtain accur estim paramet moreov optim qualiti control mainten polici insensit varianc process stoppag time henc even though one might difficulti estim specifi probabl distribut function process inspect time prevent mainten time repair mainten time optim final decis affect great long mean valu time avail final design process capac consid import take account requir qualiti control process inspect process mainten m g queue mainten polici on line sampl prevent mainten qualiti control

The modeling effort is shown to be adaptable to a wide variety of realistic rivalry situations and its related derived main conclusions are robust for a broad set of assumptions. Following a game theoretic approach, it is found that Uniform Advertising Policy (UAP) is optimal for a firm having a concave or linear response function competing against another having a concave or linear response function and thus generalizing known results for a monopoly to a duopoly. When at least one of the response functions is convex, the study demonstrates that generalizing monopolistic results might not be adequate. For such situations, the optimal policy of the firm may involve the Advertising Pulsing/Maintenance Policy (APMP) replacing the monopolistic Advertising Pulsing Policy (APP) optimal when the response function is convex, or the monopolistic UAP optimal when the response function is concave or linear. For the competitive situations involving convex response function(s), the advertising game is solved using linear programming. The Lanchester model is empirically estimated, with considerable success, using the ready-to-eat cereal data in the US. In the application reported, both response functions are found to be linear implying the superiority of UAP for the application reported. © 1995.","('Advertising', 'Competition', 'Game theory', 'Lanchester models', 'Pulsation')",a puls model advertis competit a game theoret approach part a theoret foundat in paper sequel present theoret model support numer empir analys evalu advertis polici pulsat versus uniform constant spend use static continu lanchest competit model two rival firm the model effort shown adapt wide varieti realist rivalri situat relat deriv main conclus robust broad set assumpt follow game theoret approach found uniform advertis polici uap optim firm concav linear respons function compet anoth concav linear respons function thus general known result monopoli duopoli when least one respons function convex studi demonstr general monopolist result might adequ for situat optim polici firm may involv advertis puls mainten polici apmp replac monopolist advertis puls polici app optim respons function convex monopolist uap optim respons function concav linear for competit situat involv convex respons function s advertis game solv use linear program the lanchest model empir estim consider success use readi to eat cereal data us in applic report respons function found linear impli superior uap applic report advertis competit game theori lanchest model pulsat

Heavy workload and pressure of time often create conditions in which workers are exposed to considerable safety risks.

This measure is in the form of a multiattribute value function which has an additive representation of properly scaled simple functions of single attributes. In the paper special attention is given to the problem of assessment of the scaling constants by experts. The method of weight allocation in a value tree is used for the elicitation of experts judgements of safety threats during the execution of maintenance jobs.

This formulation of the problem avoids the often difficult definition and calculation of penalty costs. The repair kit problem has been studied in literature for a single period, when restocking is possible in between jobs. In the multiple period repair kit problem studied here, restocking of the spare parts is only possible every 12 periods.

This involves four projects, 40 jobs and nine types of resources. We first develop a generalized 0-1 GP model. Because of the limited computing capacity at the mine, an effective two-phase hybrid solution approach is then proposed. In Phase I, under resource constraints, a feasible schedule is obtained by a heuristic. Based on this feasible schedule and a model-simplification procedure, many decision variables in the generalized model are eliminated and redundant constraints are removed. (Although this procedure is particularly designed for this mine, we also discuss its extension to general problems.) In Phase II, the streamlined model is solved by implicit enumeration. This approach eliminates 90% of the variables and 96% of the constraints in the problem we studied. We are thus able to solve a multi-project scheduling problem of medium size on a PC. In comparison with the heuristic method that the mine was using, our hybrid approach reduced project duration by 13%, total project cost by 30%, cost for the critical project by 15%, and overall workload by 59%. © 1994.","('0-1 goal programming', 'Limited resources', 'Mining industry', 'Multi-project scheduling')",a goal program model schedul multipl mainten project copper mine this paper describ applic goal program gp multi project resourc constrain schedul mainten miner process equip copper mine china this involv four project job nine type resourc we first develop general gp model becaus limit comput capac mine effect two phase hybrid solut approach propos in phase i resourc constraint feasibl schedul obtain heurist base feasibl schedul model simplif procedur mani decis variabl general model elimin redund constraint remov although procedur particular design mine also discuss extens general problem in phase ii streamlin model solv implicit enumer this approach elimin variabl constraint problem studi we thus abl solv multi project schedul problem medium size pc in comparison heurist method mine use hybrid approach reduc project durat total project cost cost critic project overal workload goal program limit resourc mine industri multi project schedul

The objective of such a system can be, for example, maintenance. The system's optimal size will be determined by maximizing an objective function, which is the expected value per server of a variable, incorporation of two weighted criteria that characterize the system. The first criterion is defined as the percentage of jobs that are completely served in a given time period for the whole system. The second criterion is the rate of non-utilization of the systems as defined by the ratio of unused time in the system to the total time allocated to the system. The rule for determining the size of the system is derived by maximizing the expected weighted sum of the two criteria per server. In this paper we prove a theorem for finding the optimal size of the system by employing the above mentioned objective function. An unexpected result is obtained from the analysis of the sensitivity of the parameters of the system.

The uncertainties inherent in forecasting and in the availability and operating conditions of dredges make planning difficult and may require that an uncertainty assessment be integrated into the planning process for dredging activities. This paper develops a reliability based dynamic dredging decision model that employs a simulation-optimization approach combining a hydrological simulation model of stochastic channel conditions with a dynamic location model to schedule the optimal deployment and activity levels for dredges. The benefits of this type of approach are demonstrated by application to the problem of allocating different types and sizes of dredges in order to maintain a required channel depth over time and under different reliability levels. The amounts to be dredged at any given location are incorporated into the model as chance constraints that are dependent upon the stochastic hydrologic and hydraulic channel conditions. The multiobjective optimization model assigns demobilization and mobilization costs in periods when a facility is moved from one location to another, and allows for advanced maintenance dredging, 'over-dredging' in some time periods, in order to reduce overall costs. The dredging costs considered in the model are comprised of fixed costs - assessed each period and varying by size and type of dredge employed, variable costs - dependant upon the amount of material dredged in any month, and mobilization and demobilization costs - incurred each time a dredge is moved to a new location. The multiobjective framework evaluates explicitly the manner in which dredging costs vary under different levels of reliability for maintaining the required channel depth. © 1992.","('channel maintenance dredging', 'Dynamic chance-constrained programming', 'uncertainty simulation')",develop reliabl base dynam dredg decis model accur forecast hydrolog hydraul condit use plan mainten navig channel import ensur safe cost effici water born transport the uncertainti inher forecast avail oper condit dredg make plan difficult may requir uncertainti assess integr plan process dredg activ this paper develop reliabl base dynam dredg decis model employ simul optim approach combin hydrolog simul model stochast channel condit dynam locat model schedul optim deploy activ level dredg the benefit type approach demonstr applic problem alloc differ type size dredg order maintain requir channel depth time differ reliabl level the amount dredg given locat incorpor model chanc constraint depend upon stochast hydrolog hydraul channel condit the multiobject optim model assign demobil mobil cost period facil move one locat anoth allow advanc mainten dredg over dredg time period order reduc overal cost the dredg cost consid model compris fix cost assess period vari size type dredg employ variabl cost depend upon amount materi dredg month mobil demobil cost incur time dredg move new locat the multiobject framework evalu explicit manner dredg cost vari differ level reliabl maintain requir channel depth channel mainten dredg dynam chanc constrain program uncertainti simul

Using arguments from renewal theory, basic results of the maintenance policy are established. Furthermore, some inferences are drawn regarding of maintenanc policy when both the quality and quantity issues in a production system are considered. The results indicate that the optimal maintenance policy is very sensitive to the monitoring technology adopted by the production system. If the system does not have a good monitoring technology, then preventive maintenance operations are very important to the production system. On the other hand, if the system has a good monitoring technology, it may be optimal to conduct only repair (unscheduled) maintenance operations. The results also indicate if the system is too unreliable (i.e., the probability of switching from an in-control to an out-of-control state is high), then irrespective of the maintenance policy used, the system will always incur a loss.

The proposed model is 'just tailored' on public transport, subjected to the Italian laws; it takes into account the particular activities ('functions') connected with public transport operating (e.g.: fare collection, service production, maintenance, purchases, inventories, administration). Each function is considered as a 'module' with its own constraints, and it is connected with the other 'modules', so that we can get a 'representative' model. Also the most significant parameters of the 'public transport operating problem' (e.g.: vehicle miles, passenger journeys, number of vehicles, number of employees, and so on) are connected one another. Since all relations and constraints, connecting the 'problem variables' can be represented as linear, the model structure is based on linear programming; this fact allows to pursue an optimum for one or more objective functions, each of them identifing an operational policy. So it is possible to connect simulation with optimization. A multi-period model can be used for long-range planning, pursuing a multi-year optimum; this is the most significant use. The Administrative Module contains Balance-Sheet, Cash-Flow, Profit and Loss Account, which are 'constraints' in the model and are expressed as Italian financial laws require; this structure is one of the main characteristics. Modules' dimensions and additional constraints (e.g. economic or financial ratios, fare level, turnover of inventories, and so on) can be 'tailored' on each particular case, driving the model towards more realistic solutions. © 1986.","('general transportation', 'linear programming', 'manufacturing industries', 'Planning', 'practice', 'public service')",budget long rang plan public transport an applic linear program model econom financi plan actual problem italian transport author sinc itali scarc financi resourc cover either differ cost fare proceed invest need the propos model just tailor public transport subject italian law take account particular activ function connect public transport oper e g fare collect servic product mainten purchas inventori administr each function consid modul constraint connect modul get repres model also signific paramet public transport oper problem e g vehicl mile passeng journey number vehicl number employe on connect one anoth sinc relat constraint connect problem variabl repres linear model structur base linear program fact allow pursu optimum one object function identif oper polici so possibl connect simul optim a multi period model use long rang plan pursu multi year optimum signific use the administr modul contain balanc sheet cash flow profit loss account constraint model express italian financi law requir structur one main characterist modul dimens addit constraint e g econom financi ratio fare level turnov inventori on tailor particular case drive model toward realist solut general transport linear program manufactur industri plan practic public servic

Examples of this model include production machines subject to stochastic breakdowns, and maintenance of communication systems. The cost structure of the model consists of inspection, revision and operating costs. It is intuitively reasonable that in many applications a simple control-limit rule will be optimal. Such a rule prescribes a revision only when inspection reveals that the degree of deterioration has exceeded some critical level.

Assuming that the two departments will make a decision on maintenance expenditures and production rate in a cooperative mood, we are looking for a Pareto-optimal solution. Using phase diagram analysis it turns out that the equilibrium in state-costate plane is a saddle point, implying (in the most realistic cases) decresing maintenance expenditures and increasing production rate. It is interesting to note that the basic features of the Pareto solution are the same as in the one player solution (i.e. the optimal control problem).

The system under consideration consists of a number of randomly failing replaceable components, in series. It is supposed that the failure rates and unit prices of components are not precisely known. The basic idea is to classify all system components into a given number of subcategories. Each subcategory is defined by ranges for the failure rate and the representative unit price. It is assumed that the real failure rate of a given component is randomly distributed in the corresponding subcategory range. Initially, the number of spares can be obtained if we choose a point-valued failure rate- unit price representative pair for each spare subcaterory, (λ, c) and then apply some routine optimization technique for calculating the optimum number of spares. After that, the simulation procedure is applied in order to check that the chosen pairs are acceptable representatives of the subcategory, with regard to the required probability that the total reliability of the system with spares is satisfied.

The maximum principle is applied to derive the conditions for the optimal maintenance policy and for the optimal planned sale date. Economic interpretations of these conditions are presented in terms of marginal costs and revenues. An explicit solution is found analytically for the problem in the special case when the failure probability is independent of maintenance. The case of exponentially distributed life time for the machine is analyzed in full detail.

The radiation dose can be substantially reduced by using simple periodical policies. This statement, derived from simulation of preventive maintenance policies, is in fact limited by the restricted availability of empirical data, however, the tendency of the statement remains.

The optimization problem considered models a variety of control systems, including unreliable systems subject to noisy state observations and replacement and maintenance decisions. Conditions are presented which imply the existence of optimal control laws that are monotone for completely observed and completely unobserved versions of the general, noise corrupted problem. The importance of these results is two-fold. First, presently available sufficient conditions for the existence of monotone optimal control laws for the general case are particularly restrictive and difficult to verify. Second, the substantial computational advantages that result from considering only monotone control laws emphasize the potential usefulness of the completely observed and completely unobserved results in determining bounds on optimal expected cost and suboptimal designs for the general case. © 1980, All rights reserved.",(),monoton control law noisi countabl state markov chain in paper investig effect observ qualiti optim control law structur countabl state markov system subject certain restrict cost state dynam descript the optim problem consid model varieti control system includ unreli system subject noisi state observ replac mainten decis condit present impli exist optim control law monoton complet observ complet unobserv version general nois corrupt problem the import result two fold first present avail suffici condit exist monoton optim control law general case particular restrict difficult verifi second substanti comput advantag result consid monoton control law emphas potenti use complet observ complet unobserv result determin bound optim expect cost suboptim design general case all right reserv
